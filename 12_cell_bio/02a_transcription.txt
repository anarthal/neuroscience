Regulation in bacteria mainly driven by sigma factor
!= sigma factors have != consensus sequences
Post-trancriptional modifications in tRNA
    Some parts are spliced, some amino-acids replaced by chemical modifications of amino-acids (e.g. methylated versions)
Splicing
    Splice donor: 5' intron start, has a consensus sequence
    Branch site: consensus sequence in the middle of intron
    Splice acceptor: 3' intron end, has a consensus sequence 
Nonsense-mediated decay: quality control to recognize mRNA that hasn't been spliced correctly
    Looks for stop codons in an intron (guided by the consensus sequences above). If it finds one, it means that the mRNA was not spliced correctly, and deletes the mRNA
m6A: methylation of adenines
    Reversible: can be added and deleted (writers and deleters)
    Signal for Nonsense-decay to degrade mRNA
    m6A switch: methylation causes conformation change, making it accessible so it can be degraded or translated
