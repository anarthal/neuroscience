HAYFLICK LIMIT: max num times a normal cell can divide before their telomeres become too short and die (~50)
CELL SEED: placing cells in culture (e.g. a dish) to grow them
CELL PASSAGING: seeding a portion of cells from a culture with high confluence to another dish to amplify them
PASSAGE NUMBER: the number of times that cell passaging has been performed to obtain a certain culture
Culture types according to origin
    PRIMARY CELL CULTURE: cells extracted from an in-vivo organism
    SECONDARY CELL CULTURE/CELL SUBCULTURE: cells cultured by passaging part of another culture onto a new medium
    CELL LINE: immortalized cells that can divide indefinitely without reaching the Hayflick limit (tumor or genetic modifications)
Culture types according to geometry
    2D culture: simpler but more limited
        Adherent cells: stick to surfaces
        Suspension cells: do not stick to surfaces
    3D culture: more complex but more realistic
        Resembles in-vivo because
            Not all cells are in contact with the culture surface
            Does not impose a forced apical/basal polarity
            ECM more realistic: real fibrils, can contain gradients
            Can contain many != cell types with real signalling molecules
        Types
            Spheroid: droplet hanging from a plate. E.g. for tumors
            Gels: try to mimic ECM. Natural or artificial
CONFLUENCE: in an adherent culture, % of the surface covered by cells
    Contact inhibition mechanism: cells are sensitive to mechanical signals => when they sense contact, they stop dividing
    Stop at ~70% confluence
    Cells don't attach on top of other cells, only to the treated plastic
    Trypsin: breaks all attachments from the cells to the plastic. Needs temperature
    Medium has serum with nutrients and growth factors and inactivates trypsin
