CELL SENESCENCE: cell stops dividing but doesn't die (metabolically active)
    Because oxidative stress, failed checkpoints, DNA damage...
    Specially in skin and adipose
    SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED SECRETORY PHENOTYPE: the particular seretome that identifies senescent cells
        Attracts phagocytic cells but can cause inflammation
APOPTOSIS: programmed cell death that minimizes negative consequences (vs. necrosis)
    Intrinsic pathway: triggered from the inside (e.g. failed checkpoints)
        Caspase 9
        Mitochondria liberate cytochrome c
    Extrinsic pathway: triggered externally (e.g. NK cells)
        DEATH RECEPTOR: signal receptor that causes apoptosis
        Caspase 8
    Caspase: when activated, cause apoptosis
    Procaspase: inactive caspase
NECROSIS/ONCOSIS: uncontrolled, accidental cell death
    ATP depletion and cell swelling
    Membrane breaks and contents are spilled out
    PYKNOSIS: nucleus condensation. Also happens in apoptosis
    KARYORREXHIS: nuclear envelope breaks down
        In apoptosis, it happens cleanly. Nucleus fragments enclosed in vesicles (apoptotic bodies)
        In necrosis, it happens in a chaotic way. No vesicles
    KARYOLYSIS: nuclear fragments dissolve in the cytoplasm. Afterwards, the cell breaks and spills its contents
NECROPTOSIS: programmed necrosis. Beneficial on cell infection, when apoptosis is blocked, and because it releases DAMPs
