Light microscopy: uses visible light
    Bright field: the usual, 2 lens, needs staining => can't do in-vivo
    Dark field: doesn't need staining => can do in-vivo
    Phase contrast: based on phase differences. Darker zones are dense structures, e.g. nucleus, ribosomes
        No staining => can do in vivo
    DIC/Nomarsky: variation of phase contrast, to see 3D surface
Fluorescence microscopy
    Small molecule fluorescent dyes: dye has affinity for certain molecule, e.g. DNA. You need to kill the cell
    Immunofluorescence: uses flurorescent antibodies. You need to kill the cell
    Live imaging with fluorescence: genetically modify proteins to make them fluorescent
Confocal microscopy: blocks out-of-focus light beams to obtain better resolution (vs. widefield microscopy)
    More costly
    Use only with higher magnifications
Acquisition in z-plane: illuminate one plane, then take image, repeat => 3D volume
Electron microscopy: uses electrons. Black and white images only. Can't do in-vivo
    Transmission electron microscopy: transmit through the cell. Thin sample
    Scanning electron microscopy: scan the surface. Thicker sample
