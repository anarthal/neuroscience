bright field microscopy: the usual, 2 lens, needs staining
dark field microscopy: doesn't need staining
phase contrast: based on phase differences. Darker zones are dense structures, e.g. nucleus, ribosomes
    doesn't need to kill the cell (no staining)
Nomarsky: variation of phase contrast, to see 3D surface
fluorescent dyes: you need to kill the cell
live imaging with fluorescence
    doesn't need to kill the cell
    modify genetically to make the target protein fluorescent
confocal microscopy: better resolution, but more costly. Use only with higher magnifications
acquisiton in z-plane: iluminate one plane, then take image, repeat
in general, staining or electron = needs to kill the cell
transmission electron microscopy: transmit through the cell (thin sample)
scanning electron microscopy: scan the surface. Thicker sample
    colors are artificial
