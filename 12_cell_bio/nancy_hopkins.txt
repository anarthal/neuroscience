3Rs: ethical framework when experimenting with animals
    Replacement: try to use something less sentient
    Reduction: try to use as least animals as possible
    Refinement: try to harm them as less as possible
Zebrafish: good animal model
    Homology with humans
    Less sentient than rodents => Follows 3Rs best
    Less resources than rodents


* In the academic plane, Nancy Hopkins made major contributions to cancer research
  and helped establish the zebrafish as an animal model in scientific studies.
* However, her biggest impact was perhaps in the fight for gender equality in science.
* Nancy never saw herself as an activist, but just as a scientist that wanted her work done.
* Her story as a fighter starts in 1993, in the MIT. <clk> At this point, she is starting to work with zebrafish.
* She has been working there since the 70s, so she is a pretty senior professor.
* Growing and studying zebrafish requires water tanks and this takes up a lot of physical space.
* At this point Nancy has run out of space in the lab <clk> and requests more, <clk> but her application is denied.
* This is pretty devastating for her, because it means that she can't carry on with her research.
* She feels that other people at MIT have more space than her, so she complains to her superiors but she gets ignored.
* At this point she feels that she's being treated unfairly,
  but she doesn't know if that's just her impression or not, or why is this happening.
* She and other women at MIT decide to stay late, <clk> use a measuring tape and literally measure the physical work space they have in the labs.
* They find out that all the women have much less space than men,
  even less than many men that are more junior than them.
* Together with the other women, <clk> she decides to present a report of the situation to the MIT direction.
* Since the report is fully backed with hard data, this time, they take it seriously and
  end up acknowledging that gender bias is real and actually happening at the institution.
* At this point, a committee is formed and actions to reduce the gender breach start to be taken.
* At the time, this whole case was pretty famous <clk> and had sort of ripple effect, producing changes in other universities, too.
* <clk> It's now 2025 and the gender breach is becoming smaller everyday thanks to people like Nancy.
* However, "things slide backwards if we don't keep pressing forward".
* So hopefully, when the next Nancy raises a complaint like she did,
  we can address it before she has to use measuring tape.
