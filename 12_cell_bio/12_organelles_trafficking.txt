!= compartments => specialization => != functions, more complexity
free ribosomes => synthesize proteins targeted to cell process
ribosomes in the RER => synthesized proteins targeted towards either the own cell or the outside
    all proteins generated in RER are encapsulated in vesicles. Either for exocytosis or to keep them as vesicles inside
folding happens in both RER and SER
all RER compartments are connected (== conditions)
golgi: packaging and shipping
    composed of cisternae
    cis: incoming part (receives vesicles). Can be applied for incoming cisterna, or incoming part of a cisterna
    trans: outgoing part (sends vesicles)
    incoming vesicles fuse with cis and release the cargo
    golgi then modifies the cargo, usually via glycosilation
        some functional modifications
        other, markers to specify where does the cargo go
    finally, another vesicle is formed, potentially with modifications, and it passes to the next cisternae
    tightly regulated, since failure here has serious consequences
    golgi cisternae are separated, because each cisterna has != conditions
lysosome
    acidic environment
    enzymes that break down cellular components
    digests and recycles cellular waste
    destroys pathogens (e.g. macrophages)
    autophagy: cell self-eats, to generate more energy
vesicle specificity: each vesicle has a tag that determines where it should go
smooth ER: lipid synthesis and Ca2+ storage
    distribution of SER in muscle cells must be uniform to produce fast, uniform contraction
    T tubule: invagination of cell muscle's membrane that conducts the nervous impulse (via acetylcholine)
        Causes Ca2+ release and contraction
    When acetylcholine is removed, Ca2+ removed and muscle relaxes
    Liberating Ca2+ does not require ATP, but recapturing does => Rigor mortis
lipid synthesis => happens in both ER
vesicles have proteins (usually transmembrane) that act as tag
    clathrin
    COPI
    COPII
sizeof golgi, sizeof ER depends on the cell's function, and may change in time
vesicular transport model: composition of ER does not change in time. Adequate for small time frames
cisternal maturation model: composition of ER changes in time. Adequate for long time frames
lysosomes
    hydrogen pump: pump H+ ions using ATP
    endocytosys, pinocytosis, phagocytosis and autophagy converge here
    autophagy: recycle organelles that are now non functional and obtain energy
    vesicle created by the golgi apparatus
Golgi defects may inhibit post-translational modifications => neurodegeneration
depending on signal, Golgi does !=, e.g.
    lysosome
    secretory
    constitutive: targeting the plasma membrane, to maintain equilibrium
