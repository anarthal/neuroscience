Background
    ORGANELLE: specialized subunit within a cell, e.g. nucleus, ribosomes
    VESICLE: structure of liquid surrounded by lipid bilayer
    ENDOMEMBRANE SYSTEM: composed by all membranes inside the cytosol that work together (ER, Golgi, lysosomes, vesicles; but not mitochondria)
!= compartments => Can perform !=, chemically incompatible functions, but more complex
The size and number of organelles depends on cell's function, and might change in time
Transport types
    To/from the nucleus, through nuclear pore complexes
    To ER, mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, peroxisomes: directly across their membrane
    In vesicles
ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER): membranous compartments for biosynthesis and storage
    ROUGH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (RER): has ribosomes attached to it. Protein synthesis and modification
        Ribosomes in RER: to be packed in vesicles for the endomembrane system. Vs free ribosomes: proteins for the cytosol
    SMOOTH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (SER): lipid synthesis, Ca2+ storage, detoxification
        E.g. SER in muscle cells distributed uniformly to produce fast, uniform contraction
        T tubule: invagination of cell muscle's membrane that conducts the nervous impulse (via acetylcholine)
            Causes Ca2+ release and contraction
        When acetylcholine is removed, Ca2+ removed and muscle relaxes
        Liberating Ca2+ does not require ATP, but recapturing does => Rigor mortis
    Both contain chaperones to fold proteins and maintain quality control (incorrectly folded proteins are not allowed out)
    ER STRESS: situation where unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. Triggers an unfolded protein response
        UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE: signaling cascade to synthesize more ER and chaperones, or trigger apoptosis
    ER compartments are continuous (same conditions everywhere)
GOLGI APPARATUS: receives vesicles, modifies and sorts its contents, and ships them again
    Golgi cisterna: each of the pancake-shaped sacs that compose the Golgi apparatus
    Golgi stack: a collection of stacked Golgi cisternae. A cell might have more than one stack
    Cisternae are separated (!= conditions in each one)
    Cis part: incoming (receives vesicles). Can be applied for a cisterna or a particular part of a cisterna
        Most of incoming traffic comes from ER => located close to it
    Trans part: outgoing (sends vesicles)
    Cargo can be modified in cisternae. Usually by glycosilation
    In the trans cisterna, vesicles are tagged to identify their destination: plasma membrane, lysosomes or secretion
    Models explaining how cargo moves (both true, depends on circumstance and time lapse)
        Vesicular transport model: cisternae's contents don't change with time. Inbound vesicles receive, cargo processed, outbound vesicle formed
        Cisternal maturation model: cisternae's contents change with time. Cisternae travel physically along the stack, from the cis to the trans side


    


        
    
EXOCYTOSIS: process where a cell excretes elements outside of its cytoplasm
    CONSTITUTIVE EXOCYTOSIS: 
ENDOCYTOSIS: process where a cell uptakes external elements into its cytoplasm
    Pinocytosis: uptake of small molecules (i.e. fluid). Happens in all cells
    Phagocytosis: uptake of large molecules. Happens only in specialized cells
ENDOSOME: membrane-bound organelle that acts as sorting station for vesicles internalized by pinocytosis
    Cargo might be directed to lysosomes to be degraded, returned to the membrane or set for secretion
    Early endosome: close to the cell membrane. The ones where recently arrived vesicles fuse with
    Late endosome: close to the nucleus. Formed by maturation/fusion of other endosomes
LYSOSOME: membrane-bound organelle that digests material by hydrolysis
    Acidic environment: because degrading enzymes work better with low pH
    Has a proton pump to maintain the acidic environment (consumes ATP)
AUTOPHAGY: pathway where a cell directs its own organelles to digestion in lysosomes
    Digests damaged/unnecessary organelles => material recycling
    Produces materials during starving periods
    AUTOPHAGOSOME: enclosing of an organelle to be recycled in a double membrane, so it can travel to lysosomes


vesicle specificity: each vesicle has a tag that determines where it should go
lipid synthesis => happens in both ER
vesicles have proteins (usually transmembrane) that act as tag
    clathrin
    COPI
    COPII
lysosomes
    endocytosys, pinocytosis, phagocytosis and autophagy converge here
    autophagy: recycle organelles that are now non functional and obtain energy
    vesicle created by the golgi apparatus
Golgi defects may inhibit post-translational modifications => neurodegeneration
depending on signal, Golgi does !=, e.g.
    lysosome
    secretory
    constitutive: targeting the plasma membrane, to maintain equilibrium
