GU pairing can happen, but has less strength. GC > AU > GU
Cis RNA-RNA: same molecule, vs. trans RNA-RNA
Stack/helix: secondary structure where opposite base pairs, on top of the other
Loop: everything else
    Hairpin/stem loops: single part closed by stack
    Bulge: one part of the chain has excess nucleotides that don't pair with the other
    Internal: two parts closed by stack (vs. one in hairpin)
    Multi-branched: more than 2 exits
For free Gibbs energy: directionality matters
Junction: where 3 or more RNA parts join
Pseudo-knot: knot-like, can be done/undone easily
Stacking more stable when base types stack on top of != types of bases
+ively charged ions help stabilize the structure
if ribosomes are
    cytoplasm => for the cell
    in ER => for the cell or outside the cell
proteins: scaffolding, RNA: function
ribosomes use trans RNA-RNA interactions
existence is temporary (only during translation), because they are weak interactions
there is no protein close to the active site of the ribosome
channel protects amino-acid chain from water
splicing of tRNA is NOT performed by spliceosome
