GU pairing can happen, but has less strength. GC > AU > GU
Cis RNA-RNA: same molecule, vs. trans RNA-RNA
RNA secondary structures
    Stack/helix: secondary structure where opposite base pairs, on top of the other
    Loop: everything else
        Hairpin/stem loops: single part closed by stack
        Bulge: one part of the chain has excess nucleotides that don't pair with the other
        Internal: two parts closed by stack (vs. one in hairpin)
        Multi-branched: more than 2 exits
        Exterior loop: the end of the molecule (doesn't close)
        N-loop: loop that is delimited by N base pairs (e.g. 1-loop is a simple loop)
            Closing base-pair: the base-pair delimiting the loop facing the exterior
            Enclosed base-pair: for N>1, the base-pairs that delimit the loop but face the interior
RNA tertiary structures
    Junction: where 3 or more RNA parts join
    Pseudo-knot: knot-like, can be done/undone easily
RNA stability
    Directionality matters: some base pairs are more stable if they alternate, others if they are continuous
    Stacking more stable when base types stack on top of != types of bases
    BASE STACKING: bases are planar, and if they stack on top of each other, the structure is more stable (applies to DNA, too)
    Positively charged ions help stabilize the structure
