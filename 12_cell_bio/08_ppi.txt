Background
    SUBSTRATE CHANNELING: passing a substrate from one enzyme to the next one in a chain without releasing it to the env
INTERACTOMICS: analysis of the interactions between molecules in a cell
INTERACTOME: whole set of interactions between molecules in a cell
    Size of interactome correlates with complexity
EMERGENT PROPERTY: in a complex system, property that only shows when it interacts with other systems
PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION: physical (vs. related functionality), selective contact between two proteins
    Stable: in protein complexes (e.g. hemoglobin)
    Transient: require specific conditions (e.g. all drivers of cellular processes)
    Strong: proteins bind covalently
    Weak: proteins bind non-covalently
Search space is huge. Still a lot not known
Experimental methods
    YEAST TWO-HYBRID: bind one protein to an activation domain of a TF, another to a DNA-binding domain, see if there's transcription
        For initial identification rather than detailed analysis
    TANDEM-AFFINITY PURIFICATION: checks interactions of a target protein with other proteins expressed by a cell
        Modify cells to express the protein with a TAP tag that allows for purification
        Cell lysis
        Purify the expressed protein => leave only the target protein and the proteins it interacts with
        Mass spectrometry => check what the interacting proteins are
    PROTEIN MICROARRAYS: automated detection of interactions
        Lay proteins in an array, covered with a coating where interaction takes place
        Add a != protein in each array position
        Interaction detected with fluorescent labelling
