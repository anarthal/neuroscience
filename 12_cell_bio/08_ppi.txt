Background
    SUBSTRATE CHANNELING: passing a substrate from one enzyme to the next one in a chain without releasing it to the env
    ORTHOLOGS: pair of homolog genes in two species with a common ancestor
INTERACTOMICS: analysis of the interactions between molecules in a cell
INTERACTOME: whole set of interactions between molecules in a cell
    Size of interactome correlates with complexity
EMERGENT PROPERTY: in a complex system, property that only shows when it interacts with other systems
PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION: physical (vs. related functionality), selective contact between two proteins
    Stable: in protein complexes (e.g. hemoglobin)
    Transient: require specific conditions (e.g. all drivers of cellular processes)
    Strong: proteins bind covalently
    Weak: proteins bind non-covalently
Search space is huge. Still a lot not known
Experimental methods
    YEAST TWO-HYBRID: bind one protein to an activation domain of a TF, another to a DNA-binding domain, see if there's transcription
        For initial identification rather than detailed analysis
    TANDEM-AFFINITY PURIFICATION: checks interactions of a target protein with other proteins expressed by a cell
        Modify cells to express the protein with a TAP tag that allows for purification
        Cell lysis
        Purify the expressed protein => leave only the target protein and the proteins it interacts with
        Mass spectrometry => check what the interacting proteins are
    PROTEIN MICROARRAYS: automated detection of interactions
        Lay proteins in an array, covered with a coating where interaction takes place
        Add a != protein in each array position
        Interaction detected with fluorescent labelling
Computational methods
    High-throughput, cheap, but with more false positives
    Yield a probability of interaction
    Lots of high negatives: proteins may interact without showing the landmarks recognized by these methods
    Can't distinguish between physical interaction and functional association
    PHYLOGENETIC PROFILING: assumes that two proteins encoded by genes with similar presence/absence in != organisms are related
        INTEROLOG: given two pairs of homolog genes between two species, a conserved interaction between the proteins they encode
Building the reference human interactome (no false positives)
    Combining info from all sources (machine learning) yields better results than using individual ones
    E.g. experimental studies via text mining, co-expression, phylogenetic analysis...
Topological analysis of the interactome
    DEGREE of a node: number of edges coming into the node
    DEGREE DISTRIBUTION: probability that a node has exactly degree k
    SCALE-FREE NETWORK: degree distribution P(k) = U * k^(-c) (power law) <= the one exhibited by the interactome
    Hub: node with many edges. Represent conserved proteins
    Bottleneck: pair of nodes that connect two sub-networks. Key connecting proteins
    Dynamic information: add time information (when does the protein express in the cell cycle?) to the interactome
        Party hubs: high co-expression => interact simultaneously
        Date hubs: less co-expression => might interact later in time
