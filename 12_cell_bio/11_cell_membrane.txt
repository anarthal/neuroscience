functions
    protection
    shape
    attach the cytoskeleton
    transport
    junctions
    signalling
lipids
    phospholipid
        2 hydrophobic tails, one hydrophilic head
        amphipatic: allows fusion
        participates in electron transport chain in mitochondria
    cholesterol: makes the membrane more fluid
    glycolipids: cell recognition
    can do flip-flop (turn upwards => downwards)
proteins
    few but very heavyweight
    lipids associated to physical properties, proteins to functions
    integral proteins: inserted into the membrane
        transmembrane: cross the membrane
        lipid-linked (?): covalently linked to the lipids
    associated proteins: not permanently linked to the membrane, can attach or detach
        lipid-linked
        protein-linked
carbohydrates
    glycocalyx: carbohydrate layer surrounding the cell membrane. Very important in bacteria
    lectin (surface glycoproteins in endothelium cells, part of endothelium cell's glycocalyx) binds to glycocalyx in leukocytes
    intestine: recognizes bacteria in our microbiota
can be modelled as a 2D fluid
    tends to self-close (energetically favorable)
    asymmetric (!= kind of phospholipids face inner or outer depending on type) => != potential
    fluidity increases the fluidity of cell membranes => fever increases fluidity of white blood cell membranes so they can kill easier
big or charged molecules can't go through
