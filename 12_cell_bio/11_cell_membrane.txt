Components
    Lipids: physical properties
        Phospholipid: 2 hydrophobic tails, one hydrophilic head. Main component
            Amphipatic: allows fusion
            Participates in electron transport chain in mitochondria
        Cholesterol: makes the membrane more fluid and helps maintain integrity
        Glycolipids: part of the glycocalyx
    Proteins: specific functions (e.g. signalling)
        Integral proteins: inserted into the membrane
            Transmembrane: cross the membrane
            Lipid-linked: covalently linked to the lipids
        Associated proteins: not permanently linked to the membrane, can attach or detach
    Carbohydrates: form the glycocalyx
        GLYCOCALYX: carbohydrate layer surrounding the cell membrane
        Very important in bacteria
        Mostly linked to proteins
        Cell recognition and adhesion
        Lectin (surface glycoproteins in endothelium cells, part of endothelium cell's glycocalyx) binds to glycocalyx in leukocytes
        Intestine: recognizes bacteria in our microbiota
        Only present in the membrane's outside. Not in organelles
Movement
    FLUID MOSAIC MODEL: components are in permanent movement (2D fluid)
    Flip-flop: phospholipids can turn upwards => downwards
    Tends to self-close (energetically favorable)
    Asymmetric (!= kind of phospholipids face inner or outer depending on type) => membrane potential
    Heat increases the fluidity of cell membranes => fever increases fluidity of white blood cell membranes so they can kill easier
Permeability
    Gases: permeable
    Small hydrophobic: passive diffusion
    Small uncharged polar: passive diffusion, but might need transporters
    Large uncharged polar: transporters
    Charged (ions): transporters
Types of transports
    Passive: no energy required
        Diffusion (no helper molecule)
        Osmosis: diffusion of water molecules following concentration gradients of soluble molecules
        Facilitated (ion channel or carrier protein)
        Rate of diffusion increases with concentration gradient, but stalls when carriers saturate
    Active: requires energy
        Primary active transport: uses ATP directly (e.g. Na+/K+ pump)
        Secondary active transport/contransporters: uses electrochemical gradient. E.g. couple Cl- transporting to K+ exiting the cell
            Symporter: substances move in the same direction
            Antiporter: substances move in opposite directions
    Channels are always passive, carriers may be passive (facilitated) or active
