NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX: protein complex in the nuclear membrane that allows transport of molecules
NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION SIGNAL: amino-acid sequence in proteins that allows them to be imported to the nucleus
NUCLEAR EXPORT SIGNAL: amino-acid sequence in proteins that allows them to be exported to the cytoplasm
IMPORTIN: protein that recognizes the nucleus localization signal and imports proteins
    Cargo protein: carried by importin
EXPORTIN: protein that recognizes the nucleus export signal and exports proteins
Small molecules can diffuse, but most molecules need active transport
Ran cycle
    Proteins imported to nucleus by importin
    Ran/GTP makes importin release its cargo once it gets to the nucleus
    Ran/GTP + importin exported outside the nucleus
    GTP hydrolizes => importin liberated, Ran is now Ran/GDP
    Ran/GDP imported again to the nucleus by another protein
    Ran releases GDP and picks GTP
    Ran/GTP also binds to exportin and causes export to cytoplasm
    Ran/GTP hydrolysis releases exportin and cargo
Most RNAs exported as ribonucleoproteins (RNP)
    mRNA uses non-Ran mechanism
    Rest of RNAs use Ran
