NUCLEAR ENVELOPE/MEMBRANE: double membrane that isolates nucleus from cytoplasm
    Small molecules can diffuse, but most molecules need active transport
    NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX: protein complex in the nuclear membrane that allows transport of molecules
    NUCLEOPORIN: proteins that composes the nuclear pore complex
    Cytoplasmic filaments: protein filaments towards the cytosol. Tell import factors where the pore is
    FG repeats: web of proteins with repeated sequences, covering the center of the pore
        Gel-like consistency => Diffusion barrier
        Interact with import/export factors
    Basket: protein filaments that join inside the nucleus
        Interacts with import/export factors
        Prevents heterochromatin from blocking pores
        Quality control of mRNA (prevents premRNA from leaking out)
    Set of rings (outer, inner, spoke) => Structural support
Signals
    NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION SIGNAL: amino-acid sequence in proteins that allows them to be imported to the nucleus
    NUCLEAR EXPORT SIGNAL: amino-acid sequence in proteins that allows them to be exported to the cytoplasm
Exportin/importin pathways
    IMPORTIN: protein that recognizes the nucleus localization signal and imports proteins
    EXPORTIN: protein that recognizes the nucleus export signal and exports proteins
    Cargo protein: protein carried by an importin or exportin
    Ran: GTPase protein that might be bound to GTP or GDP
        Ran/GTP: high concentration in the nucleus
        Ran/GDP: high concentration in the cytoplasm
        Ran-GAP (GTPase activating protein): promotes Ran/GTP => Ran/GDP conversion. In the cytoplasm
        Ran-GEF (guanine exchange factor): promotes Ran/GDP => Ran/GTP conversion. In the nucleus
    Protein import
        Importin recognizes localization signal and imports the protein to the nucleus
        Ran/GTP makes importin release its cargo, replaced by Ran/GTP
        Ran/GTP + importin exported outside the nucleus
        GTP hydrolyzed => importin liberated, Ran is now Ran/GDP
    Protein export
        Exportin recognizes export signal
        Exportin + Ran/GTP export the protein to the cytoplasm
        GTP hydrolysis releases exportin and cargo
    Ran/GDP and exportins carried back to the nucleus by other transporters for re-use => Ran/GDP converts into Ran/GTP
mRNA export
    Driven by other export receptors
    Quality control step before export: only correct mRNAs are exported
    Has directionality: in general, 5' end exits first
    Some RNA associated proteins dissociate in the cytoplasm and are recycled back to the nucleus
