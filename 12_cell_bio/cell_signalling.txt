Background
    Mitogen: protein that promotes cell division
Receptor classification
    Cell-surface: transmembrane proteins. Bind a ligand and activate an intracellular signal pathway
        For molecules that are too large or too hydrophilic, so they can't cross the membrane
    Intracellular: external molecule goes inside the cell
        For small, hydrophobic molecules. E.g. steroids
A cell receives many signals, but responds only to the ones it has receptors for
Effector protein: protein inside the cell that produces the final effect in a signal cascade
    Metabolic enzymes: alter metabolism
    Cytoskeletal protein: alter shape or movement
    Transcription factor: alter protein synthesis
Response timings
    Fast: if it doesn't need to reach the nucleus (example here?)
    Slow: if it needs to reach the nucleus
Intracellular signal pathways may do the following to the signal
    Relay: transmit it forward
    Amplify: increase intensity
    Integrate: merge several signal pathways into one
    Distribute: fork the pathway, distributing it to several effector proteins
    Produce feedback: change the intensity of the signal based on the effect it's having
Second messenger: signal molecule generated by the activation of a receptor (e.g. cAMP)
Molecular switch: molecule that produces effects, and that might be switched on or off
    If a pathway involves switching on a switch, it needs to also contain a mechanism to switch it off
    Phosphorylation: adding a phosphate group usually causes switch on
        Kinase switches on
        Phosphatase switches off
    GTP-binding proteins: on if GTP is bound to it, off if GDP
        GTP binding switches on
        GTP hydrolysis switches off (may be done by the GTP-binding protein itself)
        Types
            G-protein/trimeric GTP-binding proteins: relay signals from G-coupled protein receptors
            GTPases/Monomeric GTP-binding proteins: smaller
                Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF): switch on
                GTPase-activating proteins (GAP): switch off
Types of cell-surface receptors
    Ion-channel coupled receptors: ligand-gated ion channels
    G-protein coupled receptors: activate membrane-bound G proteins that relay the signal
        Threads back and forth the membrane several times
        Might directly activate ion channels
        Might activate adenyl cyclase => cAMP
            cAMP is soluble and diffuses well
            Switched off by cAMP phosphodiesterase, that eliminates cAMP (coffee blocks this)
            Concentrations change fast
            cAMP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) => phosphorylates other proteins
        Might activate phospholipase C
            Cleaves a lipid in the membrane => diaglicerol (DAG), inositol triphosphate (IP3)
            IP3 opens Ca2+ channels in the ER (signal in itself)
            DAG + Ca2+ => activates protein kinase C (PKC) => phosphorylates other effector proteins
            Ca2+ activates calmodulin => activates calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaM-kinases) => phosphorylates other proteins
        Might generate NO that diffuses into neighboring cells
        Might be fast if they don't need to reach the nucleus
        Might adapt their sensibility (e.g. rhodopsin in eye)
    Enzyme-coupled receptors: are enzymes or activate enzymes inside the cell
        Usually responses to growth factors and similar => Slow
        Might also affect cytoskeleton => Faster
        Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
            Receptors activate by making two units come together and dimerize => specific tyrosines phosphorylate
            When activated, they recruit a set of proteins around them, all sharing an interaction domain
            Many != proteins => complex pathways
            Tyrosine phosphatase shuts pathway off
            Usually activates Ras (monomeric GTP-binding protein). Ras-GEF activates, Ras-GEF deactivates
            Ras usually activates MAP-kinase signalling module (MAP = mitogen-activated protein) => cascade until nucleus
            PI-3 kinase usually involved in these pathways
            PI-3 activates protein kinase B (PK-B/Akt)
            Akt inactivates Bad, which causes apoptosis
            Akt activates Tor => Inhibits protein degradation and stimulates synthesis => Growth
    Some receptors are cleaved and go into the nucleus directly (e.g. Notch => growth)
