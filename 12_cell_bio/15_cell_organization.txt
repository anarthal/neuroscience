SECRETOME: set of molecules that a cell or organism secretes to the extracellular space
Mesenchymal tissues: connective and muscle, originated from mesoderm
Organ tissue classification
    PARENCHYMA: functional part of an organ. Usually composed of epithelial tissue
    STROMA: in an organ, set of tissues providing structural support. Usually composed of mesenchymal tissue
    Epithelial/mesenchymal transition: epithelial/mesenchymal cells might transform into the other
        Not common. Happens in embryo, tissue repair, cancer
MORPHOGENESIS: process by which a cell, tissue or organ develops its shape
ORGAN SYSTEM: group of organs that work together for a purpose
    Digestive
    Respiratory
    Urinary
    Genital
    Nervous
    Cardiovascular
    Skin
    Hematopoietic
    Immune
    Musculo-skeletal
Organ recovery
    ORGAN REGENERATION: full recovery (cells are replaced by the same cell type)
    ORGAN REPAIR: original tissue replaced by connective tissue
        Maintains integrity but loses function
    Some tissues/organs always regenerate (e.g. skin), others always repair (e.g. heart)
    More severe injury leads to repair
    Chronic inflammation leads to repair
