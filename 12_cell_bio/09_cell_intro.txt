eukaryotes: more specialized, can perform != processes thanks to membrane-bound organelles
    disadvantages: more energy and time required
Dapi stain: green & blue
microfilaments: structural support and movement
microtubules: transport and division
intermediate filaments: keep the structure of the cell
    made of != proteins depending on tissue
