Ribosome biogenesis: highly regulated. Produced more when the cell needs more proteins: cell division and proliferation
    Codified very close to the telomeres: because it can wind/unwind very easily
    Nucleolus
        Center transcribes the rRNA
        Fibrillar components => preprocessing
        Granules => assembled Ribosomes
    Gene structure
        ncRNA promoter: promoter for the gene that generates a ncRNA that helps in the assembly of ribosomes
        spacer promoter: promoter for the gene that generates a RNA that coils/uncoils DNA
            UBF: the proteins that actually uncoil the DNA
        upstream control element: the part that binds so enhancers and promoter are brought together
        T0: inhibitor
    Preprocessing: all the RNAs are produced in a chain and must be cut. Additionally
        snoRNA C/D box: methylates some nucleotides. Required to generate the hydrophobic channel for translation
    5S: the transcription factors bind within the sequence, rather than before/after
        Then transported to the nucleolus by some proteins
    Proteins: just like any other protein
        Proteins go back to the nucleus once what are produced
    Regulated: some things enhance production, others inhibit
        When there is glucose, growth factors, amino acids: cascade of reactions to activate ribosome biogenesis
