Size: microtubules > intermediate > microfilaments
MICROFILAMENTS: actin filaments
    Double helix of actin globular monomers
    Have polarity: + end tends to grow faster than - end
    Dynamic instability: constantly growing and shrinking. Consumes ATP
    Treadmilling: steady state where a microfilament gains and loses monomers at the same speed
    Actin-binding proteins: bind actin to modify its behavior. E.g. stabilize, create networks...
    Functions
        Cell migration (lamellipodia) => polymerize cytoskeleton in a certain direction
        Create a network under the cell membrane => structural support (cell cortex)
        Form microvilli
        Contractile ring for cytokinesis
        Muscle contraction (with myosin)
        Focal adhesions
        CYCLOSIS/CYTOPLASMIC STREAMING: circular movement of cytosol and organelles. Actin + myosin
MICROTUBULES: tubulin polymers
    Tube-like structure composed of dimers of alpha and beta tubulin
    Have polarity: + end tends to grow faster than - end
    Dynamic instability: constantly growing and shrinking
    Extend radially from certain locations, where the - end is anchored (no dimers lost)
        MICROTUBULE ORGANIZING CENTER (MTOC): cell locations where microtubules are nucleated
        CENTROSOME: a MTOC near the nucleus, where most transport-oriented microtubules are nucleated
        CENTRIOLES: pair of modified microtubules at the core of MTOCs. Surrounded by matrix of proteins where microtubules attach
    Tau protein: stabilizes microtubules (altered in Alzheimer)
    Functions
        Transport
            KINESIN: moves cargos towards the + end
            DYNEIN: moves cargos towards the - end
        Mitotic spindle
        Cilia and flagella
        Determine the position of membrane-bound organelles
INTERMEDIATE FILAMENTS: structural support
    Bundle of several tetramers: 2 antiparallel dimers
    Do not have polarity
    Stable: once created, they stay as they are until destroyed
    Tissue specific: each tissue has a != type of filament (e.g. neurofilaments)
    Not involved in movement
    They don't have associated proteins
    Do not need ATP/GTP to polymerize
    Functions
        Network around the nucleus and extending to the plasma membrane => structural support
        Nuclear lamina: network under nuclear envelope => structural support
        Desmosomes
INTEGRIN: cell receptors that sense changes in the ECM and participate in cell-ECM adhesion
PSEUDOPODIA: temporary cell membrane extensions for cell movement or phagocytosis
    Created by cytoskeleton polymerization, usually actin
