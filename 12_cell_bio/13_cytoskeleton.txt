microtubules > intermediate > microfilaments
to move, cells polymerize the cytoskeleton to make projections in their cytoplasm in one direction
cromosome separation and cytokinesis
forms cilia and flagella
+ end: the direction of growth, for elements that can grow (microfilaments, microtubules)
intermediate filaments
    don't have a +/- end: more stable
    immutable: once created, stays the length they are, destroyed when needed
    in charge of structure
microfilaments
    double helix of actin
    important for movement
    unstable: require actin-binding protein to be stable
        E.g. myosin
    maintains microvilli
    contractile ring in cell division
    actin can be added to the + or -, but it is added more in the +
    treadmilling: state where all that's added is removed
    the process consumes ATP
    actin alone doesn't do these, requires extra proteins
        capping: protein added to one side to avoid adding/removing monomers
        proteins may cause it to form a network
        ERM: attach to membrane
    the ones that create microvilli
myosin: motor
    family of related proteins
    myosin II = muscle contraction
microtubules
    formed by tubulin
    position of microtubules determines the position of membrane-enclosed organelles
    centrosome: the main MTOC
    1 MTOC for non-dividing, 2 for dividing, n for ciliated AZ
    pair of centrioles: modified microtubules, surrounded by centrosome matrix, where microtubules attach
    tau: stabilizes
cyclosis: circular movement of cytoplasm
    contraction of microfilaments
    in all cells (euk, prok)
intermediate filaments
    surrounding the cell
    instead of globular monomers, fiber-like monomers, thread themselves into a filament
    more stable than the others, less dynamic => cell mechanical stability
    tissue specific => != type depending on tissue (e.g. neurofilaments)
    they don't need ATP/GTP to polymerize
    not involved in cell movement
    they don't have polarity
integrin: connects cell inside-ECM
    involved in cell signalling (mechanical transduction - sense what's happening outside)
    in all cell types, not only epithelial 
    filaments, then plaque, then integrin
    hemidesmosome: with intermediate filaments => more stable
    focal adhesions => more dynamic
    occluding junctions fuse the two membranes
    gap junctions in all cells that need tight coordination (e.g. intestine epithelia)
