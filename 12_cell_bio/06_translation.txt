translation
    Universal: (almost) all organisms have the same code
        Except mitochondria and some bacteria: slight modifications
    Degenerate: reduce mutation lethality
    Similar codons code for chemically similar amino-acids: reduce mutation lethality
    The first codon is always AUG, which sets the reading frame
    Each tRNA has one anti-codon, but can pair with more than one codon (wobble pairs)
    Each tRNA is associated to only one amino-acid
    Each amino-acid has more than one tRNA associated
    AARS: enzyme that attaches amino-acids to tRNA
        One enzyme per amino-acid
        Charging/activating the tRNA: incorporating the amino-acid to the tRNA
        Bond between tRNA and amino-acid is a covalent bond
        The reaction requires ATP
        It's 2 step
        Attaches the amino-acid to the 3' end of the last A
        Parasite-specific domains: present only in parasites => attacked by antibiotic
        Catalytic domain: the one that does the work. Has a != size for each amino-acid => specificity
        Editing domain: proofreading capabilities, based on kinetics
            Detection happens in the 2nd step, when tRNA arrives
            The only amino-acid that does not fit in the editing pocket is the one that is correct
        How does it figure out which tRNA to attach it to?
            Anticodon domain recognizes anticodon, rest of allosteric domains recognize other parts of tRNA
            Terminals: parts in tRNA recognized by AARS
        Translation is two-step and steps are independent: charging of tRNA and chain building
    Speed-accuracy trade-off
    The Catalytic part of a ribosome is RNA (vs. a protein)
Initiation
    First codon is always the one for methionine
    IF: initiation factor
    Starts with the small subunit of the ribosome => Recognizes the initiation codon
    Rate of initiation is what determines speed
    1st step is making sure that the mRNA is intact
    Eukaryotes: IF recognize the poly-A tail and the cap 
        In general, IF finds the cap, then scans until 1st AUG
        But sometimes, it scans more, and starts in the 2nd or 3rd AUG => Produce != proteins
        The differences between the possible proteins is a signal that determines what should the cell do with the protein
    Prokaryotes: they don't have this integrity check => it goes faster
        Ribosome binding site: a consensus sequence in mRNA where the ribosomes bind. Allows translating poly-cistronic RNAs. Close to AUG
        Poly-cistronic mRNAs translated in parallel
        Amount of protein in poly-cistronic depends on how well the ribosome binds to its binding site
    First tRNA placed in P site
Elongation
    Elongation factors: EF
    EF helps placing tRNA in the A site using energy
        Proofreading: if the pairing tRNA/codon is not correct, the EF does not use the energy, and the tRNA is released
        Increases accuracy but decreases speed
    Peptide bond forms
    The small subunit moves, moving the tRNA forward (so it's placed in the E and P sites)
        An Elongation factor uses energy to do this
Termination
    There is no tRNA that recognizes stop codons, but another molecule: release factors
        Molecular mimics: resembles the shape of another molecule
        Release factors mimic the structure of tRNA (but it's a protein)
        It allows water to enter the ribosome => Terminates the chain
        As soon as the bond breaks from the tRNA, the protein is released
Quality control
    Prokaryotes: if the ribosome finds a tRNA without a stop codon, incorporates a sequence of amino-acids to tag the protein for degradation
    Polysomes: parallelization
