the function is determined by its 3D structure
the structure is fully determined by its amino-acid sequence
structures
    primary: amino-acid chain
    secondary: local structural motifs
    tertiary: overall 3D structure
    quaternary structure: != molecules combine together to perform a function
chirality, alpha carbon: each bond is to a != molecule
side chain that gives it its chemical properties
two possible conformations, depending on rotation of atoms
    ribosomes only incorporate L amino-acids to proteins
we read from C-terminal to N-terminal
20 amino-acids
covalent peptide bond: between the COOH and the NH2 => C an N bind and a H2O molecule is released
    rigid: doesn't allow rotation
    partial double-bond character => allows movement of electrons between atoms => prevents rotation
    proteins rotate around the carbon-alpha
        phi bond: N-carbon alpha
        psi bond: carbon alpha-carboxyl
    not all angles are possible, because side chains occupy space
    Ramachandran plot: phi vs. psi angle for each pair of consecutive amino-acids in a protein
        Each cluster in the plot is associated to a secondary structure motif
Glycine is the smallest amino-acid, doesn't have a side chain
Structure stabilized by non-covalent bonds (weaker than covalent)
    Ionic, van der Waals, hydrogen, hydrophilic/hydrophobic
    alpha-helix and beta-sheet: interactions created between the backbone
    beta-turn: closed turn between amino-acid n and n+3, because of a hydrogen bond between the backbone
        it doesn't form further structure
        changes the direction of the protein, limits its size
    alpha-helix
        side-chains are in the outside part => gives them their properties. E.g. amphipatic
        No prolines or glycines (except collagen)
        between n and n+4 (O => H in N)
        6 amino-acids per turn (less tight than beta-turn)
        can coil with other alpha helices => fibers
        can form channels
        e.g. transmembrane proteins
    beta-sheet: hydrogen bonds between amino-acids that are very far away
        anti-parallel: != chain directions. Hydrogen bonds are one on top of the other. More compact
        parallel: = chain directions. Hydrogen bonds oblicuous
        can form barrels: cylinders formed of beta-sheets
tertiary structure: interaction between side chains
    as they're in water, usually hydrophilic outside, hydrophobic inside
    structure is reversible
    similar amino-acid chains can yield very != tertiary structures
    disulfide bonds: cysteine residues have HS, which can form S-S bonds that help stabilize the structure (e.g. keratin)
    loops: chains of amino-acids that don't have a proper secondary structure, but connect consecutive secondary structures
        usually in the outer sites
        importance as recognition sites, vs. places with tertiary structure that have other functions, like catalytic
    the one with the lowest energy
        but there are many != low energy conformations that the protein may take, depending on probability, env...
        free energy = f(enthalpy, entropy)
        enthalpy = f(interaction between components of the protein)
        entropy = f(interaction with water)
Cuaternary structure
    dimer, trimer, tetramer: number of subunits
    homo-XX: if they're all the same subunit, hetero-XX: if they're != subunit
    when it's an hetero-XX, subunits usually have similar tertiary structure
Protein domains: another way to think of a protein. Part of a protein that can fold independently
    More related to the function than other structures
as soon as the protein leaves the ribosome, it starts to fold
    prevents the exposure of hydrophobic chains
    molten globule: temporary conformation, contains secondary structure
    some proteins readjust themselves and form the final conformation. Others need chaperones
        they don't determine the conformation
        heat-shock proteins: they resist high temperature and are produced at high temperature => fix folding at high T
        Use ATP
        hsp70: acts on the molten globule
        hsp60: captures incorrectly folded proteins into an isolation chamber
            it knows that it's incorrectly folded because it has hydrophobic parts exposed
proteasome: if a protein can't be folded correctly, it degrades the protein
    uses ATP
    breaks the protein into small amino-acid chains
    it's a protein itself
    core cylinder with 4 heptameric rings that has proteolytic capabilities
    two caps on top/bottom: ATP-ases and captures the proteins to be broken
    ubiquitin marks the proteins to be degraded, then the proteasome degrades them
        enzyme E1 activates ubiquitin using ATP and attaches it to E1
        then, a chain starts that are f(specific protein to be degraded) that tags the protein
    this same system is also used to degrade proteins that are no longer required
proteins can also be degraded by exposing parts of the protein to the env
Methionine is a stabilizing residue => goes 1st
    Some other amino-acids are called de-stabilizing residues => makes the protein last less
If they're not correctly folded or degraded, they aggregate and precipitate
    E.g. they expose hydrophobic parts that aggregate with each other
    Forms very tight beta sheets that can't be accessed from proteasome
