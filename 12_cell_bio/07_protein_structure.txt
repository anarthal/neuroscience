Background
    CHIRAL: object that can be distinguished from its mirror image
Amino-acids
    α-carbon joined to amino group (NH2), carboxyl (COOH), hydrogen, side chain (R)
    α-carbon is chiral
    Side chain confers physical/chemical properties
    two possible conformations, depending on rotation of atoms
        L-ISOMER vs D-ISOMER: isomers that are mirror images. They rotate light in != directions
        Ribosomes only incorporate L amino-acids to proteins
    20 amino-acids happening in nature
    Glycine is the smallest amino-acid, doesn't have a side chain
Primary structure: amino-acid sequence
    Secondary and tertiary structures completely determined by primary structure
    POLYPEPTIDE BACKBONE: repeating N, C atoms that make the peptide chain, vs. side chains
Secondary structure: local structural motifs
    Peptide bond has double-bond character: does't allow rotation along it
        Rotation can happen in the α-carbon to N and C bonds
        Phi, psi: concrete rotation angles for a particular protein
        Not all angles are possible because side chains occupy space
        Ramachandran plot: phi vs. psi angle for each pair of consecutive amino-acids in a protein
            Each cluster in the plot is associated to a secondary structure motif
    Stabilized by many weaker, non-covalent bonds
        Ionic, van der Waals, hydrogen, hydrophilic/hydrophobic
    Motifs that don't involve side-chains common because they can be formed from != amino-acid sequences
        Usually hydrogen bonds N-H <=> C-O
    BETA TURN: tight turn that changes chain direction
        Hydrogen bond between n and n+3
        Not involved in further structure because of tightness
        Limits the size of the molecule
    ALPHA HELIX: protein motif where amino-acids arrange in a helix
        Hydrogen bond between n and n+4
        Less tight than a beta turn
        Side-chains are in the outside part => special properties, e.g. amphipathic
        Common in transmembrane proteins and channels
        Coiling several helices can form fibrils (e.g. collagen)
    BETA SHEET: protein motif where amino-acids arrange in a plane
        Rigid structure
        Anti-parallel: != chain directions. Hydrogen bonds are one on top of the other. More compact
        Parallel: = chain directions. Hydrogen bonds in diagonal
        Can form barrels: cylinders formed of beta-sheets
Tertiary structure: overall 3D structure
    Determines the function of the protein
Quaternary structure: aggregation of several proteins joined by non-covalent bonds to perform a function
    
    
        
        
tertiary structure: interaction between side chains
    as they're in water, usually hydrophilic outside, hydrophobic inside
    structure is reversible
    similar amino-acid chains can yield very != tertiary structures
    disulfide bonds: cysteine residues have HS, which can form S-S bonds that help stabilize the structure (e.g. keratin)
    loops: chains of amino-acids that don't have a proper secondary structure, but connect consecutive secondary structures
        usually in the outer sites
        importance as recognition sites, vs. places with tertiary structure that have other functions, like catalytic
    the one with the lowest energy
        but there are many != low energy conformations that the protein may take, depending on probability, env...
        free energy = f(enthalpy, entropy)
        enthalpy = f(interaction between components of the protein)
        entropy = f(interaction with water)
Cuaternary structure
    dimer, trimer, tetramer: number of subunits
    homo-XX: if they're all the same subunit, hetero-XX: if they're != subunit
    when it's an hetero-XX, subunits usually have similar tertiary structure
Protein domains: another way to think of a protein. Part of a protein that can fold independently
    More related to the function than other structures
as soon as the protein leaves the ribosome, it starts to fold
    prevents the exposure of hydrophobic chains
    molten globule: temporary conformation, contains secondary structure
    some proteins readjust themselves and form the final conformation. Others need chaperones
        they don't determine the conformation
        heat-shock proteins: they resist high temperature and are produced at high temperature => fix folding at high T
        Use ATP
        hsp70: acts on the molten globule
        hsp60: captures incorrectly folded proteins into an isolation chamber
            it knows that it's incorrectly folded because it has hydrophobic parts exposed
proteasome: if a protein can't be folded correctly, it degrades the protein
    uses ATP
    breaks the protein into small amino-acid chains
    it's a protein itself
    core cylinder with 4 heptameric rings that has proteolytic capabilities
    two caps on top/bottom: ATP-ases and captures the proteins to be broken
    ubiquitin marks the proteins to be degraded, then the proteasome degrades them
        enzyme E1 activates ubiquitin using ATP and attaches it to E1
        then, a chain starts that are f(specific protein to be degraded) that tags the protein
    this same system is also used to degrade proteins that are no longer required
proteins can also be degraded by exposing parts of the protein to the env
Methionine is a stabilizing residue => goes 1st
    Some other amino-acids are called de-stabilizing residues => makes the protein last less
If they're not correctly folded or degraded, they aggregate and precipitate
    E.g. they expose hydrophobic parts that aggregate with each other
    Forms very tight beta sheets that can't be accessed from proteasome
