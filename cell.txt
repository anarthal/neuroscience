ORGANELLE: specialized subunit within a cell, e.g. nucleus, ribosomes
VESICLE: structure of liquid surrounded by lipid bilayer
Cell structure
    NUCLEUS: membrane bound organelle containing genetic material
        NUCLEOLUS: structure within nucleus that synthesizes ribosomes
        NUCLEAR ENVELOPE/MEMBRANE: bilayer membrane that isolates nucleus from cytoplasm
    CYTOPLASM: evth inside the cell membrane, except the nucleus
        CYTOSOL: liquid substance between membrane and nucleus, where organelles live
        RIBOSOME: performs protein synthesis, translating messenger RNA into proteins
        MITOCHONDRION: uses aerobic respiration to generate ATP, used as chemical energy
    CELL/PLASMA/CYTOPLASMATIC MEMBRANE: layer isolating cell from exterior
    GOLGI (APPARATUS): packages proteins in vesicles
    LYSOSOME: vesicle containing enzymes to digest biomolecules. Mostly in animal cells
    VACUOLE: vesicle for storing water, waste... more relevant in plants and fungi
    CYTOSKELETON: network of protein filaments within the cytoplasm. Mechanical structure, transport...
        MICROFILAMENT: protein filaments. Mechanical structure and motion
        MICROTUBULE: Mechanical structure, transport...
    ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM: transport system & molecule synthesis
        ROUGH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM: where ribosomes attach, so what they produce gets delivered
        SMOOTH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM: no ribosomes, also molecule synthesis
