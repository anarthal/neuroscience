MICROBIOME: ecosystem composed by the microorganisms living within the human body (or other system), their genome and their env
    It's not just bacteria - includes also other kingdoms
MICROBIOTA: the community of organisms living within the microbiome
METAGENOME: the collective genetic material of all microorganisms in the microbiome
DYSBIOSIS: disruption in the balance of microbiota
Features
    Diverse: changes between individuals
    Dynamic: changes with time, environment, diet...
    Interconnected: influences many other processes
Both host and microbes have evolved adaptations to interact with each other
Gut microbiota
    Mostly anaerobic medium
    Nutrient acquisition: ferments dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)
        Bacteroidetes and firmicutes
        Butyrate: SCFA that provides energy to colonocytes
    Vitamin synthesis
        Vitamin K: blood clotting. E.coli, bacterioides
        Vitamin B12 and others: lactobacillus, bifidobacterium
    Metabolizes some drugs
    Immune system development
        Stimulates production of antimicrobial substances
        Helps create tolerance
    Modulates the immune system (via SCFAs) => reduce inflammation
    Helps intestinal barrier integrity
        Competition with pathogens
        SCFAs help to produce mucus and tight junctions in the mucosa
    Brain-gut axis
        Communication happens primarily through the vagus nerve
        SCFAs can directly influence neurons or act by entering into the blood stream
        Aid in the synthesis of serotonin by synthesizing tryptophan
        Influence in the synthesis and regulation of dopamine and GABA
        Dysbiosis promotes anxiety and depression
        Autism spectrum disorders linked with dysbiosis
    Inflammatory bowel disease: family of diseases involving chronic inflammation in the gut. Linked to dysbiosis
    Obesity and type II diabetes linked to dysbiosis
    Atherosclerosis linked to dysbiosis: TMAO produced by microbiota on certain diets + inflammation
    Composition changes with
        Diet: the main factor. Good: dietary fiber, prebiotics. Bad: fat
        Antibiotics: dysbiosis, growth of antibiotic resistance bacteria (e.g. clostridium difficile)
        Exercise: good
        Sleep: dysbiosis may alter sleep patterns. Not getting enough sleep causes dysbiosis
        Stress: bad (stress hormone causes dysbiosis and inflammation)
Skin microbiota
    Composition influenced by humidity and amount of sebum (nutrients)
    Helps skin barrier integrity
    Competition with pathogens
    Immune system development/modulation
    Chemicals (e.g. soaps) and UV light are bad
Oral microbiota: required for oral health but can cause dental decay
    Influenced by saliva composition (nutrient vs. antimicrobial composition) and oral hygiene habits
Respiratory tract microbiota
    Mostly in the upper part
    Competition with pathogens
    Immune system development/modulation
Vagina microbiota: lactobacillus maintains it acid to prevent pathogen growth
Study techniques
    Cultivation in the lab. But some organisms are unculturable
    Microscope examination
    Biochemical tests (e.g. Gram staining)
    DNA sequencing (e.g. targeting the 16S rRNA conserved gene in bacteria)
    Bioinformatics
    Human microbiome project: in-depth characterization of human microbiota
    Longitudinal studies: study the temporal evolution of the microbiome in an individual, rather than a single snapshot
    METAGENOMICS: study of the genome of the microbiome. Can be used for personalized medicine
    Problem: we know that correlation exists, but not causation (we don't understand the mechanism)
Therapies
    PROBIOTICS: medication consisting of live microorganisms to enhance gut microbiota
        Lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, saccharomyces boulardii
        Does not benefit all patients equally (microbiota variation between individuals)
    PREBIOTICS: food ingredients that promote a healthy microbiota
        Inulin: prebiotic dietary fiber (e.g. garlic)
    FECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION (FMT): transferring fecal matter from a healthy individual into a patient with dysbiosis
        Effective against clostridium difficile
        May help irritable bowel syndrome and neurological conditions (experimental)
        Requires personalized medicine (variability of microbiota)
    SYNTHETIC MICROBIOME: standardized population of selected organisms considered beneficial
        Less variation than with FMT
        May not help all patients equally
        Experimental
    Personalized microbiome medicine: personalize microbiome-related techniques
        Microbiome profiling: identify the composition of an individual's microbiome
        Predictive modeling: try to predict microbiome-linked diseases (e.g. atherosclerosis)
        Select the most adequate probiotics and prebiotics for the patient
