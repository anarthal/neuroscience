EXTRAVASATION: recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection
    1. Local activated macrophages use interleukins to make endothelial cells express cell-adhesion molecules
        Leukocytes slow down and roll over endothelium
    2. Leukocytes pre-activate
        PRIMING: pre-activation of leukocytes that are to extravasate
    3. Leukocytes adhere to the endothelium (become arrested)
    4. Leukocytes move laterally, probing for a site to exit the blood vessel
    5. Leukocytes cross the endothelium
        TRANSENDOTHELIAL MIGRATION(TEM)/DIAPEDESIS: process of crossing the endothelium by leukocytes
    NEUTROPHIL-ENDOTHELIAL RECOGNITION: steps 1-3 for neutrophils, well characterized
        SELECTIN: CAM expressed by endothelial cells to make neutrophils roll
        INTEGRIN: CAM expressed by neutrophils. Part of the arrest process
