Background
    REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS): oxygen-based toxic molecules, e.g. O2-, H2O2
    CHEMOTACTIC MOLECULE: molecule that causes chemotaxis
    PERFORIN: enzyme that creates holes in cell membranes
    GRANZYME: enzyme that triggers apoptosis upon entering a cell
    IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE: vigilance by the immune system to prevent tumors
    ZYMOGEN/PROENZYME: molecule that can become an active enzyme after a chemical change
    LECTIN: type of protein capable of recognizing and binding specific types of carbohydrates
    MANNOSE: a concrete type of carbohydrate
COMPLEMENT SYSTEM: set of soluble proteins in blood that get activated when pathogens are encountered
    Causes lysis, inflammation and opsonization
    Proteins exist in blood as zymogens, and need to be cleaved to become active
        CN: inactive; CNa: small subunit that results from cleaving CN; CNb: big subunit. Except C2 (vice versa)
    Classical pathway: triggered by antibodies (IgM, IgG) bound to antigens
        C1 => C4 => C2 => C3 => C5 => MAC
        C1: has a recognition protein C1q (6 globular domains, octopus shape), proteases C1r, C1s
            C1q binds to antibodies constant regions => C1r activated => C1s activated => C4 activated
        C4: once cleaved, C4b binds covalently to the antigen surface recognized by C1
        C2: binds to C4b, gets cleaved by C1s => C4b2a complex (C3 convertase) => activate C3
        C3: binds to the complex and gets cleaved => C3b => C4b2a3b complex (C5 convertase) => activate C5
        C5: binds to the complex and gets cleaved => C5b => MAC
    Alternative pathway: triggered by detecting foreign surfaces (e.g. endotoxins, cell walls)
        C3 => Factor B => C3 => C5 => MAC
        Tick over: always active at low levels, gets amplified on pathogen detection
        Complement control proteins avoid getting this pathway activated against our own cells
        C3: gets continuously hydrolyzed => C3b => binds to carbohydrates in pathogens
        Factor B: binds to C3b and gets cleaved by factor D => C3b + Bb (C3 convertase)
        Amplification loop: C3 convertase cleaves more C3 => more C3b
        Another C3b molecules binds to the complex => C5 convertase
        C5: binds to the complex and gets cleaved => C5b => MAC
        Produces a lot of C3b => good at opsonization
    Lectin pathway: triggered by lectins that detect PAMPs
        MBL/MASPs => C4 => C2 => C3 => C5 => MAC
        MBL/MAPSs complex: initiator complex similar to C1
        Mannose-binding lectin (MBL): 6-headed globular molecule that recognizes PAMPs. Homologous to C1q
        Mannose-binding lectin associated serine proteases (MASP-1 and MASP-2): proteases homologous to C1r, C1s
        Like the classical pathway, but MASPs cleave C4 and C2
    Opsonization is favored by C3b
    ANAPHYLATOXIN: molecules of C3a, C4a, C5a that promote inflammation (by activating other immune cells)
    MEMBRANE ATTACK COMPLEX (MAC): complex of complement proteins that can lyse cells by creating pores in the target cell's membrane
        C5b => C6 => C7 => C8 => polymerizes C9, forming a barrel-like structure that creates the pore
EXTRAVASATION: recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection
    1. Local activated macrophages use interleukins to make endothelial cells express cell-adhesion molecules
        Leukocytes slow down and roll over endothelium
    2. Leukocytes pre-activate
        PRIMING: pre-activation of leukocytes that are to extravasate
    3. Leukocytes adhere to the endothelium (become arrested)
    4. Leukocytes move laterally, probing for a site to exit the blood vessel
    5. Leukocytes cross the endothelium
        TRANSENDOTHELIAL MIGRATION(TEM)/DIAPEDESIS: process of crossing the endothelium by leukocytes
    NEUTROPHIL-ENDOTHELIAL RECOGNITION: steps 1-3 for neutrophils, well characterized
        SELECTIN: CAM expressed by endothelial cells to make neutrophils roll
        Integrin: CAM expressed by neutrophils. Part of the arrest process
Patten recognition: immune system cells recognize molecule patterns that indicate problems (non-specific)
    PATHOGEN-ASSOCIATED MOLECULAR PATTERN (PAMP): molecular pattern in a pathogen recognized by innate immunity (e.g. lypopolysaccharides in gram negative bacteria)
    DAMAGE-ASSOCIATED MOLECULAR PATTERN (DAMP): molecular pattern that appears on tissue damage, recognized by innate immunity (e.g. free DNA)
    PATTERN RECOGNITION RECEPTOR (PRR): receptors on innate immune cells that recognize these patterns
    TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR (TLR): a particular type of PRR
Phagocytosis
    PHAGOSOME: membrane-bound vesicle where phagocyted particles are enclosed
    OPSONIZATION: covering a phagocytosis target with opsonins to make it easier to target and to process
    After recognition, the cell extends its membrane (pseudopodia), engulfs the target and detaches parts of the membrane into a phagosome
    Phagosome merges with granules with ROS, then with lysosomes => Digestion
OXIDATIVE BURST: releasing ROS to kill pathogens
    NADPH OXIDASE (NOX2): enzyme that produces ROS
Neutrophil function: war
    Phagocytosis
    Oxidative burst
    Release pro-inflammatory cytokines
    Degranulation: granules normally released in the phagosome to avoid damage, but can be released to extracellular space in severe cases
        In order: tertiary > secondary > primary
    NETosis: trapping pathogens by expelling their own chromatin (implies cell death)
        Granules released inside the neutrophil => Nucleus breaks => Expel chromatin
        NEUTROPHIL EXTRACELLULAR TRAP (NET): chromatin released by neutrophils + other proteins, capable of trapping pathogens
Macrophage function: war and cleanup
    Phagocytosis
    Oxidative burst
    EFFEROCYTOSIS: phagocytosis of apoptotic cells before they cause extra inflammation
    Clean up inflammatory cytokines
    Macrophage polarization: may be pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2). Change between them as required
    Presents antigens from phagocytosis in MHC II
Dendritic cell function: presenting antigens
    Phagocytes, but doesn't degrade as much as a macrophage => Antigens exposed in MHC II
Natural killer cell function: kill cells that might be infected or tumoral
    Has activating and inhibitory receptors. Inspects cells, and depending on what receptors say, kills or not
    Inspects MHC I. If it's absent (e.g. tumor), kills
    ANTIBODY-DEPENDANT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY: kills cells that have bound antibodies
    Kills by perforins + granzymes
