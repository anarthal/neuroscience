yeasts
    unicellular
    reproduce 
    immunosupressive therapies: e.g. organ trasplants
change yeast <=> mold in polymorphic: temperature
    usually multi in env, yeast in host
    replication cycle of candida albicans no entra
mycoses => infection of molds/yeasts
    superficial: only top level layer
    cutaneous: epithelial tissue
    subcutaneous: deeper, difficult to treat. E.g. because spores were injected
    systemic: deep tissues. Mostly in immuno-compromised
mechanisms
    enzymes: proteases, lipases, keratinases (allow penetrating more)
    mycotoxins (metabolites)
    immune modulation. E.g. dimorphism
