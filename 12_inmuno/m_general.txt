ENDOPARASITE: parasite that lives in the host's interior
ECTOPARASITE: parasite that live in the host's external surface
VIRULENCE: describes the capacity of a pathogen to cause disease
ETIOLOGY: the ultimate cause of the disease (e.g. infection, mutation)
PATHOGENESIS: sequence of events that lead to the appear of a disease
    How much pathogenesis happens depends on the host (e.g. immune system), pathogen (e.g. virulence) and env (e.g. poor hygiene)
COLONIZATION: establishment of a non-invasive, stable colony of microorganism in the host's surface (e.g. microbiota). Vs. infection
INFECTION: entry and multiplication of pathogens into a host. May or may not lead to disease
    SUBCLINICAL INFECTION: infection that causes no or mild symptoms
    CLINICAL INFECTION: infection that causes symptoms and signs
    SYMPTOM: disease-related experience reported by the patient (e.g. pain)
    Sign: measurable evidence of disease in a patient (e.g. fever)
TISSUE TROPISM: the spectrum of tissues that a pathogen may infect
Steps of pathogenesis
    1. Pathogen in a reservoir comes into contact with the host and enters it
        Skin: wounds
        Respiratory tract (mucosa): inhalation
        Gastrointestinal tract (mucosa): ingestion
        Genitourinary tract (mucosa): sexual transmission
        Conjuntiva (mucosa): eye
        Parenteral route: deposition of pathogens beneath the skin (e.g. insect bite)
    2.a. Attachment to host surfaces
        ADHESIN: protein expressed by bacteria (e.g. fimbriae) and fungi to attach to surfaces
            Target tissue needs to have complementarity with the concrete adhesin => determines the pathogen's tissue tropism
            E.g. escherichia coli binding to intestinal epithelium
            Potential therapeutic targets: should not produce antibiotic resistance (doesn't kill bacteria)
        Biofilms
    2.b. Colonization: overthrowing the local microbiota
    3.a. Invasion of host tissues
    3.b. Evading the immune system
    4. Multiplication
    5. Leaving the host to infect other hosts
