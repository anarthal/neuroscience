Unicellular, eukaryotic cells
APICAL COMPLEX: structure present in the apical part of some protozoa that allows them to enter into host cells to parasite them
PELLICLE: structure surrounding some protozoa's cell membrane. Protozoa's equivalent to a cell wall, but less rigid
CYST: resistant, low metabolism form that some protozoa can transform into when conditions are unfavorable
    E.g. survive stomach pH until reaching the intestine
    EXCYST: to exit the cyst state and transform into the active form
VARIANT SURFACE GLYCOPROTEIN: protein in the surface of trypanosoma. Involved in antigen variation
    Each trypanosoma expresses one VSG, but has genes for many different variations of the protein
    After sexual reproduction, the new trypanosoma may express != VSGs by changing gene expression
Trypanosoma may secrete molecules that degrade cytokines => Immune evasion
