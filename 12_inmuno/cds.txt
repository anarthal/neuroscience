CD4: helper T cells
CD3: anchors TCR to the cell membrane
CD8: cytotoxic T cells
CD19: surface protein in B cells that helps in signal transduction, together with CD21
CD21: surface protein in B cells that recognizes the activation of the complement system
CD28: co-stimulatory receptor in T cells, stimulated by antigen-presenting cells
CD40: surface protein expressed by APCs (e.g. B lymphocytes). Used by helper T cells to activate them
CD80, CD86: expressed by APCs. Stimulate co-stimulatory receptors in T cells
IL21: secreted by helper T cells to activate cytotoxic T cells and B cells


Interesting: CD79, CD21, CD4, CD8, CD3
