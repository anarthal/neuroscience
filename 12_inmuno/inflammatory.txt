part of the innate system
macrophages: secrete cytokines and chemokines to atract other immune cells
functions
    stop bleeding
    help repair tissue
heat, pain, redness, swelling
cytokines, chemokines make blood vessels larger => heat, redness
IL-1 => fever
tumor necrosis factor => leads to destruction (vascular permeability), but can lead to chronic inflammation
IL-6 => activates lymphocytes
Mast cells
    1st clotting to stop pathogens from going into the blood
    then heparin to open
extravasation
    cell adhesion molecules => leukocytes closer to endothelium
    sensing chemokines
    adhesion to endothelium
    search for a place dilated by chemokines => this is where I need to enter
    properly enter
chemotaxis => move upwards the chemokine gradient
neutrophils
    flagelin receptor => recognizes flagellum in bacteria
    opsonin => attaches to the surface of a pathogen to recognize it for phagocytosis
        it makes the process more efficient
    granules in neutrophils fuse with the fagosome
    oxidative burst: use O2- and H2O2 to destroy pathogens
        NOX2: se activa reconociendo patÃ³genos, y produce las especies reactivas
    kill by granules
        1st metalloproteases => cut extracellular matrix to access wherever they need to be
        2nd lactoferrin (Fe storage => required in the oxidative burst reaction), lysozymes
        3rd evth else. Elastase also breaks ECM
        they don't degranulate usually, only in case of bad infection (granules also used in phagocytosis)
    kill by suicide by chromatin (NETosis)
        happens when there's a lot of oxygen reactive species
        granules break towards the inside of the cell, cuts the nuclear membrane
        also serves to signal that something wrong is happening 
macrophages
    can use oxygen burst
    removes dead cells to prevent chronic inflammation
    M1 are pro-inflammatory, M2 are anti-inflammatory
    they have != activated genes, != receptors, != secreted cytokines
    can change from one to the other (M1 if you're losing, M2 if you're winning)
    antigen-presenting
        T lyphocytes don't know how to find antigens. They look for in receptors like MHC. If they recognize something as bad in the MHC, they activate
        MHC I: presents peptides generated by proteasome. These are present in all cells (otherwise cells are killed)
        MHC II: presents peptides generated by phagocytosis. Only in cells that can phagocyte
dendritic cells
    also phagocyte and antigen present
    but macrophages eat more and present less, and dendritic cells eat less and present more
eosinophils
    pleiotropic effects = they do a lot of != things
basophils
    promote differentiation into toxic/helper lymphocytes
natural killer cells
    it's part of innate response, rather than recognizing a specific antigen
    scan receptors to determine whether to kill or not, based on heuristics
    make synapse and secretes granules in the synaptic cleft
        perforin makes holes
        polarizes the cytoskeleton to liberate granules
