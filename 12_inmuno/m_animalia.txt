HELMINTH: multicellular worm parasite (endoparasite)
    PLATYHELMINTHES: flat worms
        TREMATODE: flat, leaf-shaped, parasitic worm. Life cycle with intermediate hosts. E.g. schistosoma, echinostoma
        CESTODE: flat, long, parasitic worm (tapeworm). E.g. taenia solium
    NEMATODE: cylindrical worm. Some are parasitic. E.g. ascaris lumbricoides
Ectoparasites
    Examples
        Lice (piojos)
        Ticks (garrapatas)
        Fleas (pulgas)
        Mites (Ã¡caros)
        Leaches (sanguijuelas)
    Vectors for disease transmission
        Biological transmission: the transmitted pathogen has part of its life cycle inside the vector
        Mechanical transmission: the transmitted pathogen is located in the vector's surface or feces
Echinostoma life cycle
    Eggs in definitive host's feces
    Eggs hatch in water => miracidia
    Miracidia invades snails => cercariae
    Cercariae invades other snails/frogs => metacercariae
    Metacecaria ingested by definitive host => adult in intestine
