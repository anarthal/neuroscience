Skin
    Physical barrier
    Chemical barrier: lipids dissolve bacterial's cell membrane
Mucosa
    Mucus traps foreign particles
    Cilia clears mucus
    Other secretions (e.g. cerumen) and hair-like structures (e.g. eyelashes) serve similar purpose
Secretions with anti-microbial substances (chemical barrier)
    E.g. saliva, tears, sweat
    LYSOZYME: enzyme that degrades peptidoglycans in bacterial cell walls
    DEFENSIN: short peptides that can form pores in prokaryotic cell membranes
        Prokaryotic cell membranes expose negative charges in the outer layer, and the peptide is cationic
    PEPSIN: stomach's main gastric enzyme
    Zinc (e.g. seminal fluid): kills pathogens
Secretions with low pH: e.g. digestive, sweat, urine, sebus
