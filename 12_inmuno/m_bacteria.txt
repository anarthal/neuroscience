Background
    CELL ENVELOPE: in bacteria, cell membranes (inner and outer if Gram-negative) + cell wall
Bacterial morphologies and arrangements: guide further 
    Coccus: spherical
    Bacillus: rod-shaped
    Spirillus: spiral
    Vibrios: comma-shaped
    Diplo-: arranged in pairs
    Strepto-: twisted chain
    Staphylococcus: cocci arranged in grape-shaped groups
    Cuboidal: sarcinae
GRAM STAINING: stain bacteria targeting the peptidoglycan component of their wall
    GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA: stain purple in Gram staining
        Inner membrane: usual lipid bilayer
        Cell wall: thick peptidoglycan layer
        TEICHOIC ACID: embedded in the peptidoglycan wall, to provide flexibility
    GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA: stain pink in Gram staining
        Inner membrane: usual lipid bilayer
        Cell wall: thin peptidoglycan layer
        Outer membrane: another lipid bilayer, with porins and lipopolysaccharides
        Lipopolysaccharides: attached to the outer membrane. Act as an endotoxin
        PORIN: transmembrane protein in the outer membrane that allows the selective passing of certain molecules
        PERIPLASMIC SPACE: space between the inner membrane and the cell wall
    Antibiotics targeting peptidoglycan synthesis (e.g. penicillin) more effective against Gram-positive
    Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides increase virulence
BACTERIAL CAPSULE: layer of polysaccharides surrounding the cell envelope (glycocalyx)
    Prevents phagocytosis by covering bacterial PAMPs (virulence factor)
    Adherence
    Holds water => protects the bacterium from dying out
PILI/FIMBRIAE: short protein threads extending from the bacterium's surface
    Adherence
    Conjugation (plasmid exchange)
FLAGELLUM: big whip-like bacterial appendage that allows bacteria to move
    Parts
        Basal body: protein complex embedded in the cell envelope that moves the rest of the flagellum
        Hook: curved segment between anchoring the filament to the basal body
        Filament: long, whip-like structure that moves in circles
    Basal body generates rotation by using a proton gradient, and moves the rest of the flagellum
    Clockwise rotation => tumbling (random direction changes); counterclockwise rotation => sustained movement in the same direction
    Arrangements
        Monotrichous: single flagellum
        Amphitrichous: two flagella in opposite poles of the cell
        Lophotrichous: several flagella in a small surface acting together
