AUTOTROPH: organism that synthesizes all their required carbon-based molecules from inorganic compounds. Vs heterotroph
Culture media
    Selective: kills some of the microorganisms (e.g. containing antibiotics)
    Differential: distinguishes between organisms depending on their metabolic capabilities (e.g. media with blood)
Bacterial growth curve phases: lag, exponential, stationary, death
Organism classification depending on their relation to temperature
    Psychrophiles: optimum at < 15ºC
    Psychrotrophs: optimum at moderate, but also at low. Food spoilage
    Mesophiles: optimum at 25-40ºC
    Thermophiles: optimum at 50-80ºC. Hot springs
    Hyperthermophiles: optimum at > 80ºC. Deep sea
Organism classification depending on their relation to oxygen
    OBLIGATE AEROBE: need oxygen
    MICROAEROPHIL: need small quantities of oxygen
    FACULTATIVE ANAEROBE: can live in anaerobic conditions, but less efficiently
    AEROTOLERANT ANAEROBE: can live with oxygen, but they don't use it
    OBLIGATE ANAEROBE: can't live with oxygen
HALOPHILE: organism that tolerates or requires large salt concentrations to grow
Glycolysis, Krebs, fermentation: see 14a_cell_respiration.txt
Photosynthesis
    Oxygenic: produces oxygen (vs. anoxygenic)
    Non-cyclic photophosphorylation: photosynthesis that converts light into ATP and NADPH (electron carrier)
    Cyclic photophosphorylation: photosynthesis that converts light into ATP only
    Calvin cycle: set of reactions following photosynthesis that converts ATP and NADPH into sugars
