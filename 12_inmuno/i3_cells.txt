Background
    LACTOFERRIN: antimicrobial protein. Generates reactive hydroxyl species
    HEPARIN: anti-coagulant
    METACHROMASIA: change in color in dye when it binds to certain substances
    LEUKOTRIENE: a type of inflammatory mediator
IMMUNOPHENOTYPING: stain with antibodies, then pass through a tube with a laser => measure the size and quantity
    CYTOMETRY: measurement of number and characteristics of cells (e.g. size, fluorescence)
    CLUSTERS OF DIFFERENTIATION (CD): surface proteins used to uniquely identify a cell type with immunophenotyping
    LIN POSITIVE (Lin+): cell that expresses a CD that allows us to classify it as belonging to a certain lineage
LEUKOCYTES/WHITE BLOOD CELLS: immune system cells
Classification according to origin
    Myeloid leukocytes: associated to innate immune system. Developed in bone marrow
        Neutrophil
        Eosinophil
        Basophil
        Mast cell
        Monocytes
        Macrophages
    LYMPHOCYTE: leukocytes that require development in lymphoid organs. Most of them associated with adaptive immunity
        Natural killer cells
        B lymphocytes and plasma cells
        T lymphocytes
Classification according to granules
    GRANULOCYTE: innate system cells with specific granules in their cytoplasm. Myeloid lineage
        SPECIFIC GRANULE: granules contained by granulocytes that are specific to that granulocyte
        Neutrophil
        Eosinophil
        Basophil
        Mast cell
    AGRANULOCYTE: leukocytes that don't contain granules (the rest, including natural-killer cells)
Progenitors
    Hematopoietic stem cell: can differentiate into any myeloid/lymphoid cell. CD34+
    Multipotent progenitor cell: changes CDs, but still has the same potential
    Common myeloid progenitor: can differentiate into any myeloid cell
    Common lymphoid progenitor: can differentiate into any lymphoid cell. CD10+
    Granulocyte-monocyte progenitor
    Terminal (specialized) cells has more condensed chromatin (don't need to express that many genes)
NEUTROPHIL: granulocyte with granules staining neutral pink
    The most abundant leukocytes
    Appears in blood and extravasates
    x1.5-x2 sizeof RBC
    Multi-lobed nucleus (2-5 lobes). Facilitates leaving the blood stream and moving through tissue
    They die quickly because they are very aggressive
    Generates energy via digesting glycogen (and not via oxidizing respiration) so it can survive in oxygen-depleted areas
        Few mitochondria
    It is not a secretory cell type: small Golgi and ER, few ribosomes
    Granule types
        Primary/azurophilic: darker. Defensins, lysozyme and other antimicrobial molecules
        Secondary: lactoferrin (hydroxyl radical)
        Tertiary: metalloproteases (cut through ECM)
EOSINOPHIL: granulocyte with granules staining bright pink/red
    Much less abundant than neutrophils, but they increase in quantity during helminthic infection and allergy
    Appears in blood and extravasates
    ~ same size as neutrophils
    Bi-lobed nucleus (usually), larger than neutrophils
    Granules
        Specific: cytotoxic molecules and inflammation modulators. No lysozyme => Does not attack bacteria
        Azurophilic: hydrolases (~lysosome)
    They secrete proteins => developed ER, Golgi, ribosomes
MAST CELL: granulocyte that resides in vascular connective tissue
    ~ same size as neutrophils
    Single-lobed nucleus
    Plasma membrane has protrusions to 'touch things'
    Heparin, proteases in granules => Increase permeability of microvasculature, to facilitate leukocyte migration
    Histamin and other inflammation mediators in granules => Involved in hypersensitivity reactions
    Can produce proteins (to refill the granules)
    Produces viral interferons
BASOPHIL: granulocyte with granules staining purple
    The least abundant granulocyte
    Only appears in blood
    ~ same size as neutrophils
    Bi-lobed nucleus, more irregular than eosinophils. Obscured by granules
    Granules are bigger than in neutrophils/eosinophils
    Granules contain heparin, histamin, heparan sulfate, leukotrienes
    Involved in hypersensitivity reactions
    Similar to mast cells, but in blood (no proteases)
MONOCYTE: precursors of macrophages and other mononuclear phagocytic cells
    In the blood stream, until they are needed => extravasate and differentiate
    ~x2-x4 sizeof RBC (the biggest)
    Indented nucleus
    Contains azurophilic lysosomes that look like granules
    Has cytoplasm protrusions
    Good at secretion
    CD14 to recognize PAMPs
MACROPHAGE: cell specialized in phagocytosis, antigen presenting and regulation
    Derived from monocytes that migrate to tissues, encounter antigens and become macrophages
    Bigger than monocytes
    Last for years in tissues
    Round, irregular nucleus. Cytoplasmic protrusions
    TISSUE-RESIDENT MACROPHAGES: specialized macrophages that permanently reside in specific tissues
        Differentiated during fetal development
        Self-maintain without input from monocytes
        Perform extra functions in addition to immunity
        Synovial type A cells (joints), osteoclasts (bone), microglia
DENDRITIC CELL: the most efficient antigen presenting cell
    Long membrane protrusions
    Mixed lymphoid and myeloid origins
    Granules contain melanin (melanocytes are dendritic cells)
    Dispersed chromatin => Active transcription
    Types
        Follicular: in spleen and lymphoid nodes
        Lymphoid: in other tissues
        Circulating: in blood (minority)
Lymphocytes: round, big nucleus with thin cytoplasm
    ~x1-x2 sizeof RBC
    2nd more abundant leukocyte, after neutrophils
    B lymphocytes and plasma cells have developed secretory organelles => antibody production
    T cytotoxic cells kill by secreting perforins
Natural killers
    Small (< 1x sizeof RBC)
    Short lifespan
    Immature: they didn't see any antigens yet (bone marrow, immune organs)
        Big nucleus, small cell
    Mature: everywhere, in bone marrow and immune organs, and liver, lungs
        Grow bigger, granules get close to the membrane
Innate lymphoid cells
    Found in tissues, not in the blood stream
    Secrete cytokines
Communication molecules
    CYTOKINE: protein involved in signalling. Can't enter the cytoplasm => uses membrane-bound receptors
    CHEMOKINE: molecule involved in cell migration (attracts cells to certain points)
    Paracrine
        Long range: diffuse a molecule that might reach many cells
        Short range: ~synaptic: to a single cell (in the cavity between cells)
    Pattern of secreted cytokines can be used to distinguish between cells having the same CD
    IL-1-like cytokines: modulators of inflammation (incl. fever)
        Secreted as inactive proforms. Part of the protein is cleaved to activate the protein
        Because under certain circumstances, they might be secreted by accident (e.g. apoptosis/necrosis)
    Gamma-chain cytokines: cell proliferation and differentiation
        they activate transcription factors => change in phenotype
        It is the receptor that has the gamma-chain. The cytokine is the ligand
    Beta-chain cytokines: cell proliferation and differentiation
    IL-6 like cytokines: can be graduated to produce less/more response, based on the cell receptors
        Involved in acute reactions
        Promotes B cell activation
    Note: STAT chains are faster
    IL10: promote immune response in epithelial tissue, then reduce inflammation when the infection is over
    Interferons: try to fight a virus/pathogen, and alert neighboring cells
        Activate genes
        Also, type I (short and acute) and III (slow but sustained) inhibit translation to inhibit virus production
        Type II recruits leukocytes
    Tumor necrosis factors
        Pro-inflammatory, might induce proliferation or apoptosis
    TGF-beta
