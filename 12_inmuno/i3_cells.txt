Background
    CYTOKINE: protein involved in signalling. Can't enter the cytoplasm => uses membrane-bound receptors
    LYSOZYME: enzyme that degrades peptidoglycans in bacterial cell walls
    LACTOFERRIN: antimicrobial protein. Generates reactive hydroxyl species
    HELMINTH: intestinal worm parasite
    HEPARIN: anti-coagulant
    METACHROMASIA: change in color in dye when it binds to certain substances
    LEUKOTRIENE: a type of inflammatory mediator
IMMUNOPHENOTYPING: stain with antibodies, then pass through a tube with a laser => measure the size and quantity
    CYTOMETRY: measurement of number and characteristics of cells (e.g. size, fluorescence)
    CLUSTERS OF DIFFERENTIATION (CD): surface proteins used to uniquely identify a cell type with immunophenotyping
LEUKOCYTES/WHITE BLOOD CELLS: immune system cells
Classification according to origin
    Myeloid leukocytes: associated to innate immune system. Developed in bone marrow
        Neutrophil
        Eosinophil
        Basophil
        Mast cell
        Monocytes
        Macrophages
    LYMPHOCYTE: leukocytes that require development in lymphoid organs. Most of them associated with adaptive immunity
        Natural killer cells
        B lymphocytes and plasma cells
        T lymphocytes
Classification according to granules
    GRANULOCYTE: innate system cells with specific granules in their cytoplasm. Myeloid lineage
        SPECIFIC GRANULE: granules contained by granulocytes that are specific to that granulocyte
        Neutrophil
        Eosinophil
        Basophil
        Mast cell
    AGRANULOCYTE: leukocytes that don't contain granules (the rest, including natural-killer cells)
NEUTROPHIL: granulocyte with granules staining neutral pink
    The most abundant leukocytes
    Appears in blood and extravasates
    x1.5-x2 sizeof RBC
    Multi-lobed nucleus (2-5 lobes). Facilitates leaving the blood stream and moving through tissue
    They die quickly because they are very aggressive
    Generates energy via digesting glycogen (and not via oxidizing respiration) so it can survive in oxygen-depleted areas
        Few mitochondria
    It is not a secretory cell type: it doesn't produce proteins to secrete them
    Granule types
        Primary/azurophilic: darker. Defensins, lysozyme and other antimicrobial molecules
        Secondary: lactoferrin (hydroxyl radical)
        Tertiary: metalloproteases (cut through ECM)
    They don't secrete proteins
EOSINOPHIL: granulocyte with granules staining bright pink/red
    Much less abundant than neutrophils
    Appears in blood and extravasates
    ~ same size as neutrophils
    Bi-lobed nucleus (usually), larger than neutrophils
    Usually low quantity, but they rise during helminthic infection and allergy
    They secrete proteins
    Specific granules contain cytotoxic molecules and inflammation modulators
        No lysozyme => Does not attack bacteria
    Contains some azurophilic granules
MAST CELL: granulocyte that resides in vascular connective tissue
    ~ same size as neutrophils
    Single-lobed nucleus
    Plasma membrane has protrusions to 'touch things'
    Heparin, proteases in granules => Increase permeability of microvasculature, to facilitate leukocyte migration
    Histamin and other inflammation mediators in granules => Involved in hypersensitivity reactions
    Can produce proteins (to refill the granules)
    Produces viral interferons
BASOPHIL: granulocyte with granules staining purple
    The least abundant granulocyte
    Only appears in blood
    ~ same size as neutrophils
    Bi-lobed nucleus, more irregular than eosinophils. Obscured by granules
    Granules are bigger than in neutrophils/eosinophils
    Granules contain heparin, histamin, heparan sulfate, leukotrienes
    Involved in hypersensitivity reactions
    Similar to mast cells, but in blood (no proteases)
Lymphocytes: round, big nucleus with thin cytoplasm
    ~x1-x2 sizeof RBC
    2nd more abundant leukocyte, after neutrophils
MONOCYTE: precursors of macrophages and other mononuclear phagocytic cells
    In the blood stream, until they are needed => extravasate and differentiate
    ~x2-x4 sizeof RBC (the biggest)
    Indented nucleus
    Contains azurophilic lysosomes that look like granules


clusters of differentiation: the surface proteins we use to recognize cells
    support cells generate cytokines to support growth of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow
    HSC cannot be distinguished with regular dye
    CD34: cell adhesion protein. It's there as long as HSC is in the bone marrow, then disappears
Terminal (specialized) cells has more condensed chromatin (doesn't need to express that many things)
Metalloprotease: can cut proteins => to cross across tissues, e.g. to exit the bone marrow
GMP: nucleus indentation
Lin+: has a marker that uniquely identifies the cell type


Macrophages: differentiated, from monocytes
    Heterogeneous
    Live in tissues
    Contains phagocytic vesicles
    "A monocyte is scanning, a macrophage is eating"
    can stay in tissues for long
    Some of them are self-maintained (they don't come from hematopoietic system). E.g. osteoclast

Dendritic cells
    Might have != origins
    Were confused with macrofages and with nervous cells
    Mono-nuclear
    Dispersed chromatin => Active transcription
    Antigen presentation
    Not unique CD
    Have melanin (melanocytes are Dendritic cells)

Natural killer cells
    Can kill other cells directly
    Contain proteases and perforin to break membranes
    Short lifespan
    Aggressive
    Immature: they didn't see any antigens yet (bone marrow, immune organs)
        Big nucleus, small cell
    Mature: everywhere, in bone marrow and immune organs, and liver, lungs
        Grow bigger, granules get close to the membrane
B cells
    Start in bone marrow (immature)
    Then go to the spleen (naive)
    Then they encounter an antigen => Plasma cell
        Very big transformation
        Very big endoplasmic reticulum
        Produce a lot of antibodies in a small time
T cells
    First in bone marrow, then in thymus
    Kill by secreting perforin
    T helper
    T cytotoxic
Innate lymphoid cells
    Found in tissues, not in the blood stream
    Secrete cytokines
Communication is important because of the complex tasks that the immune system does
    Paracrine
        Long range: diffuse a molecule that might reach many cells
        Short range: ~synaptic: to a single cell (in the cavity between cells)
    Pattern of secreted cytokines can be used to distinguish between cells having the same CD
    IL-1-like cytokines: modulators of inflammation (incl. fever)
        Secreted as inactive proforms. Part of the protein is cleaved to activate the protein
        Because under certain circumstances, they might be secreted by accident (e.g. apoptosis/necrosis)
    Gamma-chain cytokines: cell proliferation and differentiation
        they activate transcription factors => change in phenotype
        It is the receptor that has the gamma-chain. The cytokine is the ligand
    Beta-chain cytokines: cell proliferation and differentiation
    IL-6 like cytokines: can be graduated to produce less/more response, based on the cell receptors
        Involved in acute reactions
        Promotes B cell activation
    Note: STAT chains are faster
    IL10: promote immune response in epithelial tissue, then reduce inflammation when the infection is over
    Interferons: try to fight a virus/pathogen, and alert neighboring cells
        Activate genes
        Also, type I (short and acute) and III (slow but sustained) inhibit translation to inhibit virus production
        Type II recruits leukocytes
    Tumor necrosis factors
        Pro-inflammatory, might induce proliferation or apoptosis
    TGF-beta
    Chemokines: mediate migration (attract cells to certain points)
