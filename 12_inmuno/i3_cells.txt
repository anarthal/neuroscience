Background
    CYTOKINE: protein involved in signalling. Can't enter the cytoplasm => uses membrane-bound receptors
IMMUNOPHENOTYPING: stain with antibodies, then pass through a tube with a laser => measure the size and quantity
    CYTOMETRY: measurement of number and characteristics of cells (e.g. size, fluorescence)
    CLUSTERS OF DIFFERENTIATION (CD): surface proteins used to uniquely identify a cell type with immunophenotyping
LEUKOCYTES/WHITE BLOOD CELLS: immune system cells
    Myeloid leukocytes: cells associated to innate immune system. Myeloid lineage
        GRANULOCYTE: innate system cells with granules in their cytoplasm
            NEUTROPHIL:
            EOSINOPHIL:
            BASOPHIL:
            MAST CELL:
        AGRANULOCYTE: innate system cells without granules in their cytoplasm
    LYMPHOCYTE: cells associated to adaptive immune system. Lymphoid lineage


clusters of differentiation: the surface proteins we use to recognize cells
    support cells generate cytokines to support growth of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow
    HSC cannot be distinguished with regular dye
    CD34: cell adhesion protein. It's there as long as HSC is in the bone marrow, then disappears
Terminal (specialized) cells has more condensed chromatin (doesn't need to express that many things)
Metalloprotease: can cut proteins => to cross across tissues, e.g. to exit the bone marrow
GMP: nucleus indentation
Monocytes in blood, macrophages in tissues
Lin+: has a marker that uniquely identifies the cell type
Leukocytes
    Granulocytes: have granules
        Neutrophil
            1st line of combat
            Nucleus with several lobes. separated because this way they can squeeze and pass around
            They die quickly because they are very aggressive
            granules stay neutral, we can't see them a lot
            Granule types
                Primary: contains the toxins to attack. Darker
                Secondary: protein to bind iron => Creates reactive species => Hydroxyl radical (very toxic)
                Tertiary: metalloproteases. To cut through tissues
            It is not a secretory cell type: it doesn't produce proteins to secrete them
            Generates energy via digesting glycogen (and not via oxidizing respiration) so it can survive in oxygen-depleted areas
            Releases vesicles
            Neutrophil-endothelial recognition: able to leave the blood vessel under certain circumstances. Only neutriphils do this
        Eosinophils
            mostly 2 lobes in the nucleus, condensed chromatin
            usually low, but they rise during infection or allergy
            pink granules
            mostly in lungs and intestine
            they don't have lysozymes (required to attack prokaryotic cell walls) => attacks parasites
                contain cytotoxin enzymes
            they secrete proteins
            involved in allergy
        Basophils: rare. Similar to mast cells
            Two-lobe nucleus, stains a lot
            Granules are much bigger because contain molecules:
                Heparin, histamin, heparan sulfate, leukotrienes
            The main cell involved in allergy
            In the blood stream (vs. mast cells)
            Similar functions to mast cells
            Doesn't have proteases
    Agranulocytes
        lymphocytes
            Very big nucleus
    Monocytes
        Big
        Indented nucleus
        Mostly euchromatin
        In the blood stream, until they are needed => differentiate to macrophages
        Lysosomes
        Has a receptor to "see" objects

Mast cells: in peripheric tissues, except avascular ones
    mono-nucleus, cytoplasm full of granules
    protrusions serve to 'touch things'
    granules contain inflammation mediators (e.g. histamine)
    recognition of foreign particles
    can produce proteins (to refill the granules)

Macrophages: differentiated, from monocytes
    Heterogeneous
    Live in tissues
    Contains phagocytic vesicles
    "A monocyte is scanning, a macrophage is eating"
    can stay in tissues for long
    Some of them are self-maintained (they don't come from hematopoietic system). E.g. osteoclast

Dendritic cells
    Might have != origins
    Were confused with macrofages and with nervous cells
    Mono-nuclear
    Dispersed chromatin => Active transcription
    Antigen presentation
    Not unique CD
    Have melanin (melanocytes are Dendritic cells)

Natural killer cells
    Can kill other cells directly
    Contain proteases and perforin to break membranes
    Short lifespan
    Aggressive
    Immature: they didn't see any antigens yet (bone marrow, immune organs)
        Big nucleus, small cell
    Mature: everywhere, in bone marrow and immune organs, and liver, lungs
        Grow bigger, granules get close to the membrane
B cells
    Start in bone marrow (immature)
    Then go to the spleen (naive)
    Then they encounter an antigen => Plasma cell
        Very big transformation
        Very big endoplasmic reticulum
        Produce a lot of antibodies in a small time
T cells
    First in bone marrow, then in thymus
    Kill by secreting perforin
    T helper
    T cytotoxic
Innate lymphoid cells
    Found in tissues, not in the blood stream
    Secrete cytokines
Communication is important because of the complex tasks that the immune system does
    Paracrine
        Long range: diffuse a molecule that might reach many cells
        Short range: ~synaptic: to a single cell (in the cavity between cells)
    Pattern of secreted cytokines can be used to distinguish between cells having the same CD
    IL-1-like cytokines: modulators of inflammation (incl. fever)
        Secreted as inactive proforms. Part of the protein is cleaved to activate the protein
        Because under certain circumstances, they might be secreted by accident (e.g. apoptosis/necrosis)
    Gamma-chain cytokines: cell proliferation and differentiation
        they activate transcription factors => change in phenotype
        It is the receptor that has the gamma-chain. The cytokine is the ligand
    Beta-chain cytokines: cell proliferation and differentiation
    IL-6 like cytokines: can be graduated to produce less/more response, based on the cell receptors
        Involved in acute reactions
        Promotes B cell activation
    Note: STAT chains are faster
    IL10: promote immune response in epithelial tissue, then reduce inflammation when the infection is over
    Interferons: try to fight a virus/pathogen, and alert neighboring cells
        Activate genes
        Also, type I (short and acute) and III (slow but sustained) inhibit translation to inhibit virus production
        Type II recruits leukocytes
    Tumor necrosis factors
        Pro-inflammatory, might induce proliferation or apoptosis
    TGF-beta
    Chemokines: mediate migration (attract cells to certain points)
