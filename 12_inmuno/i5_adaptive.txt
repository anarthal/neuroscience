Characteristics
    Last line of defense
    Slowest to activate
    Targets a specific antigen
    Specificity not inherited in the genome
    Polygenic
T lymphocytes
    Helper T cell (CD4): activate other cells
        Can only identify antigens in MHC II
        Cytokines for B cell differentiation into plasma cells, cytotoxic T cell activation, macrophage activation
        Some persist as memory cells
    Cytotoxic T cell (CD8): kill infected cells
        Can only identify antigens in MHC I
        Require helper T cell cytokines to be activated
        Some persist as memory cells
    Regulatory T cell (CD4, CD25): inhibit immune system response
B lymphocytes: responsible for humoral immunity (antibodies)
    Can identify antigens anywhere
    When an antigen is identified, internalized and presented in MHC II => Activation of helper T cells
    Require helper T cell cytokines to differentiate into a plasma cell and produce antibodies
B cell receptor (BCR)
    Immunoglobulin (Y shaped), bound to the membrane
    Each cell has BCRs specific for one antigen type
    Secreted antibodies are immunoglobulins with the same specificity as the BCR, but free
    Stimulatory co-receptors: detecting the antigen it's not enough for activation. Co-receptors enhance the activation signal
        Regular PRRs
        CD21/CR2 (complement receptor): recognizes complement fragments attached to pathogens => The complement was not enough to kill the pathogen
            C3d: what remains of the complement
        CD40: recognized by helper T cells, for further activation
    Activation (by helper T cells): cloning and differentiation


Humoral response: carried by liquids (antibodies)
    Binds to pathogens or its products => opsonization (enhances macrophages)
    neutralization: for instance, binds to virus receptors so it can't enter the cell
        or block the toxin
    recruits other cells
        activates the complement (classical pathway)
        enhance phagocytosis
        stimulate natural-killer cells
Antibody structure
    quaternary structure: chains are never alone
    two heavy chains, two light chains
    hinge region being flexible makes the antibody have more range for recognition
    Fab: variable part
    Fc (fragment crystalizable): constant part
    Ig domain: a particular tertiary structure, composed of beta sheets
        Doesn't have to be in immune molecules, but is common there
        Two types (both beta-sandwich): V, C
        V has more strands
    N-terminal is the antigen binding site, and very variable
    Heavy chain (from N-terminal): VH, CH1, CH2, CH3
    Light chain: VL, CL
    Constant region has structural function, so it's more structurally similar
    Pairs of chains are identical => 2 equal binding sites => increases the avidity (strength of interaction to antigen)
    variability concentrated in 3 regions (hypervariable regions): HV1, HV2, HV3 (external parts of the loop)
        HV3 the most variable
    Antigen and antibody linked by weak bonds
        stronger one is electrostatic, also hydrophobic
    All expressed by B cells
    if Fc is free (and not attached to a rigid structure), it can activate the complement system
IgA: can cross the epithelium => can be secreted
IgG1: can cross the placenta => innate immunity from mother
IgG1, 2, 3, 4: can enter the tissue => the ones that kill stuff in the tissue
IgM and IgD: the ones "by default", produced by naive B cells and when they just activate
    Once they fully differentiate, they may switch the type of antibody produced
    Naive B cells have receptors for them
IgM
    has no binge region: cannot flex
    secreted as a pentamer
    receptor is like the monomer
    J chain: joiner
    low affinity: one union doesn't establish very strong weak
    high avidity: the collective strength of all the unions (pentamer) makes binding strong
    mainly in blood, never in tissues
    activates the complement
    good agglutinin => completely cover the pathogen so it can't do any harm
        it's good at agglutinating pathogens (virus, bacteria) because they have many repeated receptors (e.g. corona spikes) where it can bind
    to a lesser extent, also secreted (J chain recognized by epithelial cells). but it's very big so not as efficient as IgA
IgA
    dimeric form: the more usual. Also as a monomer
    Has also J chain => recognized for secretion
    rigid. Not good to activate complement
    good for neutralization of stuff in the outside (e.g. saliva)
    also circulating, but we don't know what it does
    transcytosis: make IgA cross the epithelium
        the receptor that recognizes the J chain is internalized and serves as a tag to tell the cell that the vesicle should be expelled in the apical domain
    gives babies passive immunity (immunity before it develops its immune system), together with IgG
    also secreted in the mother's milk => passive immunity
    plasma cells in MALT
IgG
    the most abundant in serum
    small
    can cross placenta
    can cross epithelium because they're small
    can get into the tissues
    Differences in the antibody type (IgG1, IgG2...) depend on the number of disulfide bonds in the hinge region
    live in the blood for a long time => we don't need to wait until a plasma cell produces it to perform its function
    having the disulfide bonds in the upper region changes how they bind things
        makes them more rigid, activate complement less
    complement system activator
    capacity to activate NK cells
    capacity to produce opsonization
    IgG4 can create hybrids: 2 != variable chains, for 2 != antigens
IgE
    under skin and mucosal areas
    can sansitivize mast cells (located under skin and mucosal areas)
    monomer
    no hinge region
    molecule is very flexible
    concentration increases on allergy
    combats helminths
    does not activate complement. does not fight bacteria
    produces hypersentitivity reactions
    mast cells have receptors for IgE
    cross linked to an antigen => a lot of antibody strongly bound to the antigen
    when a lot of antibody bound to antigen => mast cell degranulates
IgD
    we don't know what it does
    expressed by naive B cells
    long hinge => can be cut by proteases and we find separated variable and constant regions
    may help neutralization/opsonization of bacteria
Antigen presentation: exposing antigens in certain structures for recognition by lymphocytes
    MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX (MHC): structure in cell surfaces that presents antigens
T cells
    Can't recognize anything that is soluble. Only when displayed in MHCs
    Do not secrete antibodies - TCR bound to membrane
    TCR has 2 chains: alpha and beta. Heterodimer
    hypervariable sites are the ones that bind antigens
    only recognizes linear antigens: by comparing the amino-acid chain
    MHCI: proteasome. All nucleated cells have them
        MHC are polygenic and polymorphic
        there are 6 MHC types, encoded by 6 != genes. We expressed all of them (although mostly HLA-A, B and C)
        each gene has many != possible alleles
        if a T cell recognizes an MHC that is not the one its used to, it kills
        loading happens inside ER
    MHCII: from phagocytosis
        Also polymorphic, polygenic
        But as it's only expressed by macrophages and other APCs, not as problematic for transplants
        loaded in vesicle that digested the pathogen
    Once the T cell has recognized something, they then look for the concrete combination of antigen + MHC type (i.e. same antigen, != type of MHC does not work)
    Cross-presentation: dendritic cells can present in their MHCI things they've phagocyted, while other cells can only place them in MHCII
    MHCI activates cytotoxics (CD8), MHCII activates helpers (CD4)
    CD4 and CD8: co-receptors, increase the response that TCR would otherwise generate
        lateral contact, in a place != to where the antigen is bound
    TCR gamma-delta: have a != amino-acid structure in their TCR, minoritary
        bind antigens but don't recognize MHC antigens
    CD3: required for the TCR to be in the membrane and work
    ITAMs: where CD3 phosphorylate (via an intrmediate kinase)
    Some co-receptors increase response strength: activates a parallel cascade that converges and makes the response stronger
lymphopoiesis
    central/primary lymphoid organs: where lymphocytes are produced
    B cells: bone marrows
    T cells: thymus in kids, lymphoid nodules in adults
    secondary lymphoid organs: MALT, spleen, nodes <= where they encounter antigens
B cell development
    generation of BCRs (bone marrow)
    negative selection (check they don't recognize self antigens, bone marrow)
    migration to secondary organs
    encounter antigen
    CD19: lineage marker for B cells
from common lymphoid progenitor to B cell
    1. pre-pro: start in the bone marrow
        close to mesenchymal stromal cells
            mechanical support
            cytokines
        (names not required) VCAM1: adhesion molecule in the stromal cell
        stromal cell and pre-pro are bound by adhesion molecules
        pre-proliferative signal: stromal cell tells B cell to proliferate
        stromal cell produces cytokines to make B cell differentiate (express new genes)
        initiates somatic recombination: recombination of immunoglobulin genes to produce != BCRs
    2. pro: somatic recombination finished
        immunoglobulin gene has several kind of segments, categories:
            V segment: variable
            D segment: diversity
            J segment: joining
        light chain has 2 genes, heavy just 1
        by recombining we choose 1 segment of each type (although light chains don't have D)
        V-D-J recombination: for heavy chain
        each segment type flanked by conserved sequences that identify segment type
        at this point, D and J are chosen
    3. late-pro
        still in the bone marrow
        another cytokine (IL7) => proliferation
        at this point, V is chosen
        the 2 chromosomes are probably != => one is shut off
    4. large pre
        Ig gene: has one exon for each type of antibody it might express, separated by introns
        pre-BCR: has the variable region we chose, and the IgM heavy chain
        the other types for when we do class switching
        surrogate light chain: a chain we know it's okay, but it can test whether the heavy chain is OK
            doesn't bind antigens, but bind to things in the bone marrow
            if it binds successfully, it's OK and we can proceed. Otherwise, apoptosis
            we try the 2nd chromosome if the 1st one didn't work
        this is called positive selection
        this cell now proliferates
    5. small pre
        recombines the light chain
        has only L and J segments
        combinatorial joining: the diversity generated by introducing variability in the heavy and in the light chains
    6. Immature B cell
        After the light chain is recombined, detaches from stromal cell
        has 4 genes (2 in each chromosome) to choose from. Has either kappa or lambda, not both
        performs another test
    Negative selection: do not harm yourself
        in the bone marrow
        if it doesn't recognize anything, allowed to go
        if it does
            binds strongly to something => killed
            binds moderately => go backwards and recombine again (by changing the light chain)
        this is called central tolerance
    Now goes to the spleen
        changes the alternative splicing to make also IgX?
        white pulp
            B cell follicles, where naive B cells go
            T cells
            has also many antigen-presenting cells, so the B cells watch
