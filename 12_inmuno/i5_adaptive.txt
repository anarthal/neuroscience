targets one specific antigen
specificity not inherited in the genome
innate encoded in a single gene, while adaptive is polygenic
BCR
    Immunoglobulin
    Each cell has BCRs that recognizes one antigen
    Antibodies secreted by B cell are equal to BCRs, but free
    When a B cell sees an antigen (priming) => Proliferation by mitosis to generate many cells equal than this
    Then generate antibodies => becomes plasma cell
    BCR complex: Ig alpha/beta + thing that recognizes the antigen + 
    When BCR recognizes antigen, cascade that activates certain genes to produce antibodies
    Genes involved with
        cell cycle progression (so it can divide)
        cytokines (so it can communicate with other cells)
        glucose metabolism (to be able to produce things)
        cyoskeletal organization
    Internalizes the recognized antigen and the receptor
        once you have no more receptors, the signal no longer is there
    Places the recognized antigen in MHC-II
BCR co-receptors: enhance the response of BCR
    CD21/CR2 (complement receptor): recognizes a complement fragment
        C3d: the complement gets deactivated so it does not kill evth, this is what remains. Attached to the pathogen
        CD21 recognizes the complement fragment, together with CD19 sends a signal and speeds up the response
B-cell co-stimulatory receptors: required to become a plasma cell
    Signals provided by helper T-cells (they recognize MHC-II antigens)
    CD40 is in the T-cell, CD40-ligand in the B cell (wrong in the slides)
    The contact makes the T-cell recognize the B-cell so it can send cytokines, sends a signal for activation
Humoral response: carried by liquids (antibodies)
    Binds to pathogens or its products => opsonization (enhances macrophages)
    neutralization: for instance, binds to virus receptors so it can't enter the cell
        or block the toxin
    recruits other cells
        activates the complement (classical pathway)
        enhance phagocytosis
        stimulate natural-killer cells
Antibody structure
    quaternary structure: chains are never alone
    two heavy chains, two light chains
    hinge region being flexible makes the antibody have more range for recognition
    Fab: variable part
    Fc (fragment crystalizable): constant part
    Ig domain: a particular tertiary structure, composed of beta sheets
        Doesn't have to be in immune molecules, but is common there
        Two types (both beta-sandwich): V, C
        V has more strands
    N-terminal is the antigen binding site, and very variable
    Heavy chain (from N-terminal): VH, CH1, CH2, CH3
    Light chain: VL, CL
    Constant region has structural function, so it's more structurally similar
    Pairs of chains are identical => 2 equal binding sites => increases the avidity (strength of interaction to antigen)
    variability concentrated in 3 regions (hypervariable regions): HV1, HV2, HV3 (external parts of the loop)
        HV3 the most variable
    Epitope: part of the antigen than gets recognized
    Antigen and antibody linked by weak bonds
        stronger one is electrostatic, also hydrophobic
    All expressed by B cells
    if Fc is free (and not attached to a rigid structure), it can activate the complement system
IgA: can cross the epithelium => can be secreted
IgG1: can cross the placenta => innate immunity from mother
IgG1, 2, 3, 4: can enter the tissue => the ones that kill stuff in the tissue
IgM and IgD: the ones "by default", produced by naive B cells and when they just activate
    Once they fully differentiate, they may switch the type of antibody produced
    Naive B cells have receptors for them
IgM
    has no binge region: cannot flex
    secreted as a pentamer
    receptor is like the monomer
    J chain: joiner
    low affinity: one union doesn't establish very strong weak
    high avidity: the collective strength of all the unions (pentamer) makes binding strong
    mainly in blood, never in tissues
    activates the complement
    good agglutinin => completely cover the pathogen so it can't do any harm
        it's good at agglutinating pathogens (virus, bacteria) because they have many repeated receptors (e.g. corona spikes) where it can bind
    to a lesser extent, also secreted (J chain recognized by epithelial cells). but it's very big so not as efficient as IgA
IgA
    dimeric form: the more usual. Also as a monomer
    Has also J chain => recognized for secretion
    rigid. Not good to activate complement
    good for neutralization of stuff in the outside (e.g. saliva)
    also circulating, but we don't know what it does
    transcytosis: make IgA cross the epithelium
        the receptor that recognizes the J chain is internalized and serves as a tag to tell the cell that the vesicle should be expelled in the apical domain
    gives babies passive immunity (immunity before it develops its immune system), together with IgG
    also secreted in the mother's milk => passive immunity
IgG
    the most abundant in serum
    small
    can cross placenta
    can cross epithelium because they're small
    can get into the tissues
    Differences in the antibody type (IgG1, IgG2...) depend on the number of disulfide bonds in the hinge region
    live in the blood for a long time => we don't need to wait until a plasma cell produces it to perform its function
    having the disulfide bonds in the upper region changes how they bind things
        makes them more rigid, activate complement less
    complement system activator
    capacity to activate NK cells
    capacity to produce opsonization
    IgG4 can create hybrids: 2 != variable chains, for 2 != antigens
IgE
    under skin and mucosal areas
    can sansitivize mast cells (located under skin and mucosal areas)
    monomer
    no hinge region
    molecule is very flexible
    concentration increases on allergy
    combats helminths
    does not activate complement. does not fight bacteria
    produces hypersentitivity reactions
    mast cells have receptors for IgE
    cross linked to an antigen => a lot of antibody strongly bound to the antigen
    when a lot of antibody bound to antigen => mast cell degranulates
IgD
    we don't know what it does
    expressed by naive B cells
    long hinge => can be cut by proteases and we find separated variable and constant regions
    may help neutralization/opsonization of bacteria
