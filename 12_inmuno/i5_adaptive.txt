targets one specific antigen
specificity not inherited in the genome
innate encoded in a single gene, while adaptive is polygenic
BCR
    Immunoglobulin
    Each cell has BCRs that recognizes one antigen
    Antibodies secreted by B cell are equal to BCRs, but free
    When a B cell sees an antigen (priming) => Proliferation by mitosis to generate many cells equal than this
    Then generate antibodies => becomes plasma cell
    BCR complex: Ig alpha/beta + thing that recognizes the antigen + 
    When BCR recognizes antigen, cascade that activates certain genes to produce antibodies
    Genes involved with
        cell cycle progression (so it can divide)
        cytokines (so it can communicate with other cells)
        glucose metabolism (to be able to produce things)
        cyoskeletal organization
    Internalizes the recognized antigen and the receptor
        once you have no more receptors, the signal no longer is there
    Places the recognized antigen in MHC-II
BCR co-receptors: enhance the response of BCR
    CD21/CR2 (complement receptor): recognizes a complement fragment
        C3d: the complement gets deactivated so it does not kill evth, this is what remains. Attached to the pathogen
        CD21 recognizes the complement fragment, together with CD19 sends a signal and speeds up the response
B-cell co-stimulatory receptors: required to become a plasma cell
    Signals provided by helper T-cells (they recognize MHC-II antigens)
    CD40 is in the T-cell, CD40-ligand in the B cell (wrong in the slides)
    The contact makes the T-cell recognize the B-cell so it can send cytokines, sends a signal for activation
Humoral response: carried by liquids (antibodies)
    Binds to pathogens or its products => opsonization (enhances macrophages)
    neutralization: for instance, binds to virus receptors so it can't enter the cell
        or block the toxin
    recruits other cells
        activates the complement (classical pathway)
        enhance phagocytosis
        stimulate natural-killer cells
Antibody structure
    quaternary structure: chains are never alone
    two heavy chains, two light chains
    hinge region being flexible makes the antibody have more range for recognition
    Fab: variable part
    Fc (fragment crystalizable): constant part
    Ig domain: a particular tertiary structure, composed of beta sheets
        Doesn't have to be in immune molecules, but is common there
        Two types (both beta-sandwich): V, C
        V has more strands
    N-terminal is the antigen binding site, and very variable
    Heavy chain (from N-terminal): VH, CH1, CH2, CH3
    Light chain: VL, CL
    Constant region has structural function, so it's more structurally similar
    Pairs of chains are identical => 2 equal binding sites => increases the avidity (strength of interaction to antigen)
    variability concentrated in 3 regions (hypervariable regions): HV1, HV2, HV3 (external parts of the loop)
        HV3 the most variable
    Epitope: part of the antigen than gets recognized
    Antigen and antibody linked by weak bonds
        stronger one is electrostatic, also hydrophobic
