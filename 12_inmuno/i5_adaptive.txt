Background
    AGGLUTINATION: joining several particles or cells together
    TRANSCYTOSIS: transporting of vesicles from one side of a cell to another, through the cell's interior
Characteristics
    Last line of defense
    Slowest to activate
    Targets a specific antigen
    Specificity not inherited in the genome
    Polygenic
T lymphocytes
    Helper T cell (CD4): activate other cells
        Can only identify antigens in MHC II
        Cytokines for B cell differentiation into plasma cells, cytotoxic T cell activation, macrophage activation
        Some persist as memory cells
    Cytotoxic T cell (CD8): kill infected cells
        Can only identify antigens in MHC I
        Require helper T cell cytokines to be activated
        Some persist as memory cells
    Regulatory T cell (CD4, CD25): inhibit immune system response
B lymphocytes: responsible for humoral immunity (antibodies)
    Can identify antigens anywhere
    When an antigen is identified, internalized and presented in MHC II => Activation of helper T cells
    Require helper T cell cytokines to differentiate into a plasma cell and produce antibodies
B cell receptor (BCR)
    Immunoglobulin (Y shaped), bound to the membrane
    Each cell has BCRs specific for one antigen type
    Secreted antibodies are equal to BCR, with small changes. Same antigen specificity
    Stimulatory co-receptors: detecting the antigen it's not enough for activation. Co-receptors enhance the activation signal
        Regular PRRs
        CD21/CR2 (complement receptor): recognizes complement fragments attached to pathogens => The complement was not enough to kill the pathogen
            C3d: what remains of the complement
        CD40: recognized by helper T cells, for further activation
    Activation (by helper T cells): cloning and differentiation
Functions of antibodies: humoral response (extracellular fluid)
    Opsonization
    NEUTRALIZATION: bind to pathogen or toxin so it can't perform its function
    Recruit other cells: macrophages, NKs, complement
Antibody structure
    IgG as model because it's the most common one
    IMMUNOGLOBULIN FOLD: two beta sheets (beta sandwich) joined by a disulfide bond
    IMMUNOGLOBULIN DOMAIN (Ig domain): a domain with an immunoglobulin fold
    Two == heavy chains (4 Ig domains), two == light chains (2 Ig domains)
    Variable region (V): part of a chain that changes from molecule to molecule. In charge of antigen recognition
        In the N-terminal domain, in both the heavy and the light chain
        Forms 2 antigen binding sites
    Constant region (V): the other parts. In charge of neutralization, opsonization...
    HINGE REGION: flexible region in the heavy chain. Increases range for recognition
    Light-heavy and heavy-heavy joined by disulfide bonds
    Domain names: VH, CH1, CH2, CH3 (heavy); VL, CL (light)
    ANTIBODY AFFINITY: the strength of the interaction between a single antigen binding site and the antigen
    ANTIBODY AVIDITY: the total strength of the interaction between the antibody and the antigen (more binding sites => more avidity)
    HYPERVARIABLE REGION/COMPLEMENTARITY-DETERMINING REGION (CDR): each of the sites in the variable portion where variability is concentrated
        3 CDRs in each V region: HV1, HV2, HV3/CDR1, CDR2, CDR3
        2x3 = 6 CDRs form a single antigen-binding site
    FRAMEWORK REGION: regions between CDRs in the V region. Structural support
        FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4
    EPITOPE: the part of the antigen recognized by the antibody
    Antibody-antigen bind via non-covalent bonds (most important ones electrostatic and hydrophobic)
ANTIBODY ISOTYPE: each class of antibody (E.g. IgG, IgD). Distinguished by their C region
    ANTIBODY SUBISOTYPE: subclass of a certain isotype (e.g. IgG1, IgG2)
    All have either 4Ig domains + hinge region or 5Ig domains
    CLASS SWITCHING: process where a plasma cell changes the isotype of its secreted antibodies and BCR
IgM: expressed as BCR by default in naive cells
    No hinge region
    Secreted as pentamer, joined by J-chain => Higher avidity
    Mainly in blood (pentamer too big to enter tissues)
    Activates the complement
    Agglutinates pathogens
    Can be secreted (has a J-chain), but not as efficiently as IgA because pentamers are big
IgA: secreted (mucosa, saliva, MALT). 2nd most common
    As a monomer (internal fluids) and dimer with J-chain (secreted)
    Neutralization
    Passive immunity to newborns (secreted with breast milk)
    Secreted by transcytosis. J-chain is recognized by epithelial cells
    Has hinge region
IgM: 1st most common
    In blood, interstitial fluid, saliva, breast milk...
    Can cross placenta => Protect fetus
    Can cross epithelial cells because it's small
    Subisotypes: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 (!= number of disulfide bonds in the hinge region)
    Live long in plasma => Fast response to re-infection. No need to produce it again
    Activates the complement
    Activates NKs
    Opsonization
    IgG4 can create hybrids: 2 != variable chains, for 2 != antigens
IgE: helminths and allergies
    Monomer
    No hinge region but flexible
    Under the skin and mucose. Not in blood
    Binds to mast cells and activates them (degranulation) when an antigen binds to it
    Does not activate the complement or fight bacteria
IgD: expressed as BCR by default in naive cells
    We don't know what it does
    Long hinge => can be cut by proteases and we find separated variable and constant regions
    May help neutralization/opsonization of bacteria





Antigen presentation: exposing antigens in certain structures for recognition by lymphocytes
    MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX (MHC): structure in cell surfaces that presents antigens
T cells
    Can't recognize anything that is soluble. Only when displayed in MHCs
    Do not secrete antibodies - TCR bound to membrane
    TCR has 2 chains: alpha and beta. Heterodimer
    hypervariable sites are the ones that bind antigens
    only recognizes linear antigens: by comparing the amino-acid chain
    MHCI: proteasome. All nucleated cells have them
        MHC are polygenic and polymorphic
        there are 6 MHC types, encoded by 6 != genes. We expressed all of them (although mostly HLA-A, B and C)
        each gene has many != possible alleles
        if a T cell recognizes an MHC that is not the one its used to, it kills
        loading happens inside ER
    MHCII: from phagocytosis
        Also polymorphic, polygenic
        But as it's only expressed by macrophages and other APCs, not as problematic for transplants
        loaded in vesicle that digested the pathogen
    Once the T cell has recognized something, they then look for the concrete combination of antigen + MHC type (i.e. same antigen, != type of MHC does not work)
    Cross-presentation: dendritic cells can present in their MHCI things they've phagocyted, while other cells can only place them in MHCII
    MHCI activates cytotoxics (CD8), MHCII activates helpers (CD4)
    CD4 and CD8: co-receptors, increase the response that TCR would otherwise generate
        lateral contact, in a place != to where the antigen is bound
    TCR gamma-delta: have a != amino-acid structure in their TCR, minoritary
        bind antigens but don't recognize MHC antigens
    CD3: required for the TCR to be in the membrane and work
    ITAMs: where CD3 phosphorylate (via an intrmediate kinase)
    Some co-receptors increase response strength: activates a parallel cascade that converges and makes the response stronger
lymphopoiesis
    central/primary lymphoid organs: where lymphocytes are produced
    B cells: bone marrows
    T cells: thymus in kids, lymphoid nodules in adults
    secondary lymphoid organs: MALT, spleen, nodes <= where they encounter antigens
B cell development
    generation of BCRs (bone marrow)
    negative selection (check they don't recognize self antigens, bone marrow)
    migration to secondary organs
    encounter antigen
    CD19: lineage marker for B cells
from common lymphoid progenitor to B cell
    1. pre-pro: start in the bone marrow
        close to mesenchymal stromal cells
            mechanical support
            cytokines
        (names not required) VCAM1: adhesion molecule in the stromal cell
        stromal cell and pre-pro are bound by adhesion molecules
        pre-proliferative signal: stromal cell tells B cell to proliferate
        stromal cell produces cytokines to make B cell differentiate (express new genes)
        initiates somatic recombination: recombination of immunoglobulin genes to produce != BCRs
    2. pro: somatic recombination finished
        immunoglobulin gene has several kind of segments, categories:
            V segment: variable
            D segment: diversity
            J segment: joining
        light chain has 2 genes, heavy just 1
        by recombining we choose 1 segment of each type (although light chains don't have D)
        V-D-J recombination: for heavy chain
        each segment type flanked by conserved sequences that identify segment type
        at this point, D and J are chosen
    3. late-pro
        still in the bone marrow
        another cytokine (IL7) => proliferation
        at this point, V is chosen
        the 2 chromosomes are probably != => one is shut off
    4. large pre
        Ig gene: has one exon for each type of antibody it might express, separated by introns
        pre-BCR: has the variable region we chose, and the IgM heavy chain
        the other types for when we do class switching
        surrogate light chain: a chain we know it's okay, but it can test whether the heavy chain is OK
            doesn't bind antigens, but bind to things in the bone marrow
            if it binds successfully, it's OK and we can proceed. Otherwise, apoptosis
            we try the 2nd chromosome if the 1st one didn't work
        this is called positive selection
        this cell now proliferates
    5. small pre
        recombines the light chain
        has only L and J segments
        combinatorial joining: the diversity generated by introducing variability in the heavy and in the light chains
    6. Immature B cell
        After the light chain is recombined, detaches from stromal cell
        has 4 genes (2 in each chromosome) to choose from. Has either kappa or lambda, not both
        performs another test
    Negative selection: do not harm yourself
        in the bone marrow
        if it doesn't recognize anything, allowed to go
        if it does
            binds strongly to something => killed
            binds moderately => go backwards and recombine again (by changing the light chain)
        this is called central tolerance
    Now goes to the spleen
        changes the alternative splicing to make also IgX?
        white pulp
            B cell follicles, where naive B cells go
            T cells
            has also many antigen-presenting cells, so the B cells watch
