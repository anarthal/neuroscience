Background
    AGGLUTINATION: joining several particles or cells together
    TRANSCYTOSIS: transporting of vesicles from one side of a cell to another, through the cell's interior
Characteristics
    Last line of defense
    Slowest to activate
    Targets a specific antigen
    Specificity not inherited in the genome
    Polygenic
Antigen presentation: exposing antigens in certain structures for recognition by lymphocytes
    MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX (MHC): structure in cell surfaces that presents antigens
    MHC I: presents peptides generated by proteasome
        Present in all nucleated cells (otherwise cells are killed)
        Loaded in the ER and sent in a vesicle to the cell surface
    MHC II: presents peptides generated by phagocytosis
        Present only in antigen-presenting cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells)
        Loaded in the phagosome
    Antigen-binding cleft: where MHC present antigens to be recognized
    Highly polygenic and polymorphic
        Both have several isotypes, and each individual expresses molecules of each isotype
        Each related gene has a lots of different possible alleles
        Differentiate between self and extraneous (protection), but makes transplants difficult (specially MHC I)
    Cross-presentation: dendritic cells can present in their MHCI things they've phagocyted, while other cells can only place them in MHCII
T lymphocytes
    Helper T cell (CD4): activate other cells
        Can only identify antigens in MHC II
        Cytokines for B cell differentiation into plasma cells, cytotoxic T cell activation, macrophage activation
    Cytotoxic T cell (CD8): kill infected cells
        Can only identify antigens in MHC I
        Require helper T cell cytokines to be activated
    Regulatory T cell (CD4, CD25): inhibit immune system response
B lymphocytes: responsible for humoral immunity (antibodies)
    Can identify antigens anywhere
    When an antigen is identified, internalized and presented in MHC II => Activation of helper T cells
    Require helper T cell cytokines to differentiate into a plasma cell and produce antibodies
Memory cells: after activation, a small population of B and T lymphocytes persist to respond quicker if the same antigen is re-encountered
B cell receptor (BCR)
    Immunoglobulin (Y shaped), bound to the membrane
    Each cell has BCRs specific for one antigen type
    Secreted antibodies are equal to BCR, with small changes. Same antigen specificity
    Stimulatory co-receptors: detecting the antigen it's not enough for activation. Co-receptors enhance the activation signal
        Regular PRRs
        CD21/CR2 (complement receptor): recognizes complement fragments attached to pathogens => The complement was not enough to kill the pathogen
            C3d: generated by cleaving C3b
        CD40: recognized by helper T cells, for further activation
    Activation (by helper T cells): cloning and differentiation
Functions of antibodies: humoral response (extracellular fluid)
    Opsonization
    NEUTRALIZATION: bind to pathogen or toxin so it can't perform its function
    Recruit other cells: macrophages, NKs, complement
Antibody structure
    IgG as model because it's the most common one
    IMMUNOGLOBULIN FOLD: two beta sheets (beta sandwich) joined by a disulfide bond
    IMMUNOGLOBULIN DOMAIN (Ig domain): a domain with an immunoglobulin fold
    Two == heavy chains (4 Ig domains), two == light chains (2 Ig domains)
    Variable region (V/Fab): part of a chain that changes from molecule to molecule. In charge of antigen recognition
        In the N-terminal domain, in both the heavy and the light chain
        Forms 2 antigen binding sites
    Constant region (C/Fc): the other parts. In charge of neutralization, opsonization...
    HINGE REGION: flexible region in the heavy chain. Increases range for recognition
    Light-heavy and heavy-heavy joined by disulfide bonds
    Domain names: VH, CH1, CH2, CH3 (heavy); VL, CL (light)
    ANTIBODY AFFINITY: the strength of the interaction between a single antigen binding site and the antigen
    ANTIBODY AVIDITY: the total strength of the interaction between the antibody and the antigen (more binding sites => more avidity)
    HYPERVARIABLE REGION/COMPLEMENTARITY-DETERMINING REGION (CDR): each of the sites in the variable portion where variability is concentrated
        3 CDRs in each V region: HV1, HV2, HV3/CDR1, CDR2, CDR3
        2x3 = 6 CDRs form a single antigen-binding site
    FRAMEWORK REGION: regions between CDRs in the V region. Structural support
        FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4
    EPITOPE: the part of the antigen recognized by the antibody
    Antibody-antigen bind via non-covalent bonds (most important ones electrostatic and hydrophobic)
ANTIBODY ISOTYPE: each class of antibody (E.g. IgG, IgD). Distinguished by their C region
    ANTIBODY SUBISOTYPE: subclass of a certain isotype (e.g. IgG1, IgG2)
    All have either 4Ig domains + hinge region or 5Ig domains
    CLASS SWITCHING: process where a plasma cell changes the isotype of its secreted antibodies and BCR
IgM: expressed as BCR by default in naive cells
    No hinge region
    Secreted as pentamer, joined by J-chain => Higher avidity
    Mainly in blood (pentamer too big to enter tissues)
    Activates the complement
    Agglutinates pathogens
    Can be secreted (has a J-chain), but not as efficiently as IgA because pentamers are big
IgA: secreted (mucosa, saliva, MALT). 2nd most common
    As a monomer (internal fluids) and dimer with J-chain (secreted)
    Neutralization
    Passive immunity to newborns (secreted with breast milk)
    Secreted by transcytosis. J-chain is recognized by epithelial cells
    Has hinge region
IgG: 1st most common
    In blood, interstitial fluid, saliva, breast milk...
    Can cross placenta => Protect fetus
    Can cross epithelial cells because it's small
    Subisotypes: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 (!= number of disulfide bonds in the hinge region)
    Live long in plasma => Fast response to re-infection. No need to produce it again
    Activates the complement
    Activates NKs
    Opsonization
    IgG4 can create hybrids: 2 != variable chains, for 2 != antigens
IgE: helminths and allergies
    Monomer
    No hinge region but flexible
    Under the skin and mucose. Not in blood
    Binds to mast cells and activates them (degranulation) when an antigen binds to it
    Does not activate the complement or fight bacteria
IgD: expressed as BCR by default in naive cells
    We don't know what it does
    Long hinge => can be cut by proteases and we find separated variable and constant regions
    May help neutralization/opsonization of bacteria
T-cell receptor (TCR)
    2 != chains (heterodimer) bound to membrane: alpha and beta chains
    Each chain has 2 Ig domains
    Has 3 hypervariable regions, like the BCR
    Can only recognize antigens presented in MHC (nothing dissolved)
    MHC restriction: TCR only recognizes antigens bound to a specific type of MHC molecule
        Recognizes antigen + MHC complex
    TCR co-receptors: align the TCR with the MHC to increase the binding strength
        Contacts the MHC laterally, leaving the antigen-binding cleft free
        CD4 for helpers (MHC II), CD8 for cytotoxic cells (MHC I)
    TCR gamma-delta: have structurally different chains than alpha-beta
        Minority
        Binds antigens but doesn't recognize MHC antigens
    CD3: required for the TCR to be in the membrane and work
    Co-stimulatory receptors: activated by antigen presenting cells to make the activation response stronger
