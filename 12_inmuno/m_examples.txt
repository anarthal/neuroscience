Streptococcus pneumoniae
    Gram positive
    Has capsule
    Does antigen variation: != strains have != polysaccharides in their capsule
Streptococcus pyogenes (scarlatine - strawberry tongue)
    Gram positive
    Antigen mimicry with heart tissue
Staphylococcus aureus (usual comensal, opportunistic pathogen that causes almost everything)
    Gram positive
    Can release superantigens
    Releases hemolysis: lyses red blood cells
Bacillus anthracis
    Gram positive
    Has capsule
    Can form spores
Escherichia coli
    Gram negative
    Rod-shaped
    Has fimbriae/pili
    Can bind to intestinal epithelial cells via adhesins in their fimbriae
    Uropathogenic e. coli does the same but for epithelial cells in the urinary tract
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
    Gram negative
    Diplococcus
    Has adhesive pili (type IV) that bind to genital tract
    Pili undergo antigen variation
Helicobacter pylori (stomach ulcers)
    Gram negative
    Has flagella
    1/2 of global population has it, but mostly asymptomatic
    Expresses adhesins to adhere to the gastric epithelium
    Can damage tissue and induce cancer
    Modulates immune response by inducing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (biofilms in cystic fibrosis)
    Gram negative
    Rod-shaped
    Wide antibiotic resistance (hospital acquired illnesses)
    Usually opportunistic pathogen: may form biofilms in compromised patients, like people having cystic fibrosis (no mucus clearance)
Salmonella (gastrointestinal infection)
    Gram-negative
    Bacillus
    Acid-resistant: can survive stomach and inside macrophages
    Has fimbriae to attach to intestinal epithelial cells
    Intracellular parasite
    Can enter cells via zippering (interacting with receptors)
Listeria monocytogenes (listeriosis - gastroenteritis, meningitis)
    Gram positive
    Can enter cells via triggering (no receptors involved)
    Can escape phagosomes (listeriolysin)
    Can hijack the actin cytoskeleton to move through the cell and jump to other cells
    Transmitted by eating contaminated food
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (mild diarrhea)
    Gram negative
    Can enter cells via zippering (interacting with receptors using invasins)
    Transmitted by eating contaminated food
Chlamydia trachomatis
    Gram negative
    Obligate intracellular parasite
    Sexually transmitted - usual std symptoms
    Elementary body: infectious, resistant form of the bacterium that can enter host cells
    Reticulate body: non-infectious, replicative form of the bacterium after it has entered the host
    EB enters cell => forms an inclusion (vacuole) => changes to RB and replicates => forms more EB => lysis
Clostridium botulinum (botulism)
    Bacillus
    Gram positive
    Can form spores
    A-B toxin that affects neurons at the neuromuscular junction
    Botox comes from this toxin
    Eating contaminated food with the toxin, swallowing the spores, entering wounds
Clostridium tetani (tetanus)
    Bacillus
    Gram positive
    Can form spores
    A-B toxin that inhibits inhibitory neurotransmitters
Vibrio cholerae (cholera - small intestine, diarrhea, vomiting)
    Vibrio (comma shaped)
    Gram negative
    A-B toxin that activates cAMP production => ion imbalance, loss of water
Plasmodium (malaria)
    Protozoa
    Has apical complex
Trypanosoma brucei (sleeping sickness)
    Protozoa
    Does antigen variation via VSG
    Uses tse-tse fly as vector
Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease)
    Protozoa
    Uses kissing bugs as vector
    Modulates immune response by inducing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
Saccharomyces cerevisiae: yeast
Candida albicans (candidiasis - white tongue)
    Usually a commensal organism in microbiota
    Opportunistic pathogen: in immunocompromised individuals, it may grow too much
Histoplasma capsulatum (histoplasmosis - respiratory symptoms)
    Dimorphic fungi (mold outside, yeast inside the host)
Blastomyces dermatitidis (blastomycosis - lungs and skin)
    Dimorphic fungi (mold outside, yeast inside the host)
Schistosoma (schistosomiasis)
    Trematode
    Uses snails as intermediate host
    Live within the blood vessels
Taenia solium (pork tapeworm)
    Cestode
    Uses pigs as intermediate host, humans as definitive host
Ascaris lumbricoides (ascariasis)
    Nematode
    Uses no intermediate host (eggs in feces)
    Lives in the human intestine, although it travels through the heart and respiratory system while developing
Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis)
    Protozoa, has apical complex, sporozoa
    Humans are intermediate hosts, cats are the definitive hosts
    Uncooked meat or cat feces
