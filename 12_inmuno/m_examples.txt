Streptococcus pneumoniae
    Gram positive
    Has capsule
Bacillus anthracis
    Gram positive
    Has capsule
    Can form spores
Escherichia coli
    Gram negative
    Rod-shaped
    Has fimbriae/pili
    Can bind to intestinal epithelial cells via adhesins in their fimbriae
    Uropathogenic e. coli does the same but for epithelial cells in the urinary tract
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
    Gram negative
    Diplococcus
    Has adhesive pili (type IV) that bind to genital tract
    Pili undergo antigen variation
Helicobacter pylori (stomach ulcers)
    Gram negative
    Has flagella
    1/2 of global population has it, but mostly asymptomatic
    Expresses adhesins to adhere to the gastric epithelium
    Can damage tissue and induce cancer
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (biofilms in cystic fibrosis)
    Gram negative
    Rod-shaped
    Wide antibiotic resistance (hospital acquired illnesses)
    Usually opportunistic pathogen: may form biofilms in compromised patients, like people having cystic fibrosis (no mucus clearance)
Salmonella (gastrointestinal infection)
    Gram-negative
    Bacillus
    Acid-resistant: can survive stomach and inside macrophages
    Has fimbriae to attach to intestinal epithelial cells
    Intracellular parasite
Clostridium
    Bacillus
    Gram positive
    Can form spores
Plasmodium (malaria)
    Protozoa
    Has apical complex
Trypanosome brucei (sleeping sickness)
    Protozoa
    Does antigen variation via VSG
Saccharomyces cerevisiae: yeast
Candida albicans (candidiasis - white tongue)
    Usually a commensal organism in microbiota
    Opportunistic pathogen: in immunocompromised individuals, it may grow too much
Histoplasma capsulatum (histoplasmosis - respiratory symptoms)
    Dimorphic fungi (mold outside, yeast inside the host)
Blastomyces dermatitidis (blastomycosis - lungs and skin)
    Dimorphic fungi (mold outside, yeast inside the host)
Schistosoma (schistosomiasis)
    Trematode
    Uses snails as intermediate host
    Live within the blood vessels
Taenia solium (pork tapeworm)
    Cestode
    Uses pigs as intermediate host, humans as definitive host
Ascaris lumbricoides (ascariasis)
    Nematode
    Uses no intermediate host (eggs in feces)
    Lives in the human intestine, although it travels through the heart and respiratory system while developing
Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis)
    Protozoa, has apical complex, sporozoa
    Humans are intermediate hosts, cats are the definitive hosts
    Uncooked meat or cat feces
