Background
    RNase, DNase, protease: enzymes that destroy RNA, DNA, proteins
    Bacteria phages: virus that infects bacteria
    VIRION: a single, complete virus entity
    Steps of virus infection: landing, attachment, penetration, protein/DNA synthesis, assembly, lysis
    LYSIS: cell death by bursting
    hnRNA: heterogeneous nuclear RNA - RNA that lives in the nucleus, usually because it's still not mature to get exported
    CODON: a series of 3 consecutive nucleotides. Fundamental unit of translation
    Molecule structure levels
        Primary: the linear chain of functional groups that composes it. E.g. chain of nucleotides
        Secondary: local spatial conformation of molecules. E.g. DNA double-stranded helix
        Tertiary: 3D structure of the molecule. E.g. the full DNA double helix
        Quaternary: grouping of several molecules. E.g. ribosomes
Central dogma of biology: genetic information flows in direction DNA => RNA => proteins
    REPLICATION: copying DNA
    TRANSCRIPTION: using DNA to synthesize RNA
    TRANSLATION: using RNA to synthesize proteins
    RETROTRANSCRIPTION: using RNA to synthesize DNA. Exception to central dogma, rare (virus)
    GENOME: the entire DNA in an organism, including nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA
    TRANSCRIPTOME: the set of all RNA transcripts of a cell/individual
    PROTEOME: the set of all proteins that a cell may synthesize
The transcriptome
    CODING RNA (~4%): gets translated into proteins
        DNA gets transcribed into precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) - also called primary transcript
        Then converted to messenger RNA (mRNA): the one that gets translated into proteins
    NON-CODING RNA (rest): RNA that doesn't get translated into proteins, but has other functions
        Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (and pre-rRNA): the main component of ribosomes
        Transfer RNA (tRNA): specifies the meaning of each codon in mRNA. Physically bound to amino-acids
        Small non-coding RNA (sncRNA): <200bp
            Small nuclear RNA (snRNA): splicing of pre-mRNA
            Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA): processes pre-rRNA
            Regulatory
                Micro RNA (miRNA): regulates gene expression
                Short temporal RNA (stRNA): regulation during development
                Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA): regulates transcription of transposons (e.g. LINE-1, Alu)
                Small interfering RNA (siRNA): similar to miRNA, != origin
                Repeat-associated silencer RNA (rasiRNA): regulates transcription of repeated sequences, derived from themselves
        Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
        CRISPR RNA (crRNA): immune system in prokaryotes
Nucleic acid primary structure
    NUCLEOTIDE BASE/NUCLEOBASE: nitrogen-based compound: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), guanine (G), uracil (U)
        PURINES (big): adenine (A), guanine (G)
        PYRIMIDINES (small): uracil (U), thymine (T), cytosine (C)
    PENTOSE: monosaccharide with 5 carbons
        β-D-ribose for RNA: has an OH group in 2'
        β-D-deoxyribose for DNA: has an H in 2', more stable
    Phosphate group: PO_4 anion (has negative charge)
    PHOSPHODIESTER BOND: phosphate where two of the Os bind to C
    NUCLEOTIDE: monomer formed by pentose + phosphate group + nucleobase
    Backbone: alternating phosphate - pentose, nucleobases bind to pentose
        Pentose 1': carbon where nucleobase binds
        Pentose 3'/5': carbons binding to next/prev phosphate
    Chain has polarity: orientation matters
        3' end: ends in a pentose with an OH group instead of a phosphodiester bond
        5' end: ends in a phosphate group with an extra O-
        Read chains from 5' to 3', stating only nucleobases
DNA secondary structure (Watson & Crick)
    Chargaff's rules: in double-stranded helix, %A=%T, %G=%C
    Double stranded helix
        Each strand runs in anti-parallel: one from 5' to 3', the other from 3' to 5'
        Nucleobases bind to the opposite strand's nucleobases via hydrogen bonds
        COMPLEMENTARITY: each nucleobase binds to exactly one other: AT (AU), GC
    BASE PAIR (bp): fundamental unit of nuclear acid: two nucleobases bound together by hydrogen bonds + backbone
    DENATURATION: separating strands. RENATURATION: rebind strands together
        H bonds weaker than phosphodiester bonds => Easier to separate strands than to break them
        AT has 2 bonds, GC has 3 => != energy to separate
        MELTING TEMPERATURE (Tm): temperature required to denature 1/2 of DNA
            Tm = f(particular DNA helix)
            Increases with num hydrogen bonds (length and GC content)
            Increases with ionic strength: negative charges repulse and destabilize, but cations shield these
    Helix characteristics
        Right-handed (clockwise)
        10bp/turn, 0.34nm/bp, 2nm diameter
        Major (2.4nm) and minor (1.0nm) grooves
    Types of secondary structure
        B-DNA: the usual, when water-rich
        A-DNA: if water-poor, more compact
        Z-DNA: zig-zag, left handed, when salt concentration is high
RNA structure
    U replaces T, ribose (OH) replaces deoxyribose
    Secondary structure: more diverse. usually single-stranded, with loops, discontinuities, and non-complementaries
        E.g. tRNA: clover leaf structure that enables its function
    Tertiary structure: varied (high rotational freedom), allows RNA to work as an enzyme
        PSEUDOKNOT: structure formed when a secondary structure interacts with distant, complementary base pairs
    Less stable than ADN
    RIBOZYME: enzyme composed of RNA, e.g. RNase P (transforms pre-tRNA => rRNA)
