Background
    RNase, DNase, protease: enzymes that destroy RNA, DNA, proteins
    Bacteria phages: virus that infects bacteria
    VIRION: a single, complete virus entity
    Steps of virus infection: landing, attachment, penetration, protein/DNA synthesis, assembly, lysis
    LYSIS: cell death by bursting
    hnRNA: heterogeneous nuclear RNA - RNA that lives in the nucleus, usually because it's still not mature to get exported
    CODON: a series of 3 consecutive nucleotides. Fundamental unit of translation
Central dogma of biology: genetic information flows in direction DNA => RNA => proteins
    REPLICATION: copying DNA
    TRANSCRIPTION: using DNA to synthesize RNA
    TRANSLATION: using RNA to synthesize proteins
    RETROTRANSCRIPTION: using RNA to synthesize DNA. Exception to central dogma, rare (virus)
    GENOME: the entire DNA in an organism, including nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA
    TRANSCRIPTOME: the set of all RNA transcripts of a cell/individual
    PROTEOME: the set of all proteins that a cell may synthesize
The transcriptome
    CODING RNA (~4%): gets translated into proteins
        DNA gets transcribed into precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) - also called primary transcript
        Then converted to messenger RNA (mRNA): the one that gets translated into proteins
    NON-CODING RNA (rest): RNA that doesn't get translated into proteins, but has other functions
        Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (and pre-rRNA): the main component of ribosomes
        Transfer RNA (tRNA): specifies the meaning of each codon in mRNA. Physically bound to amino-acids
        Small non-coding RNA (sncRNA): <200bp
            Micro RNA (miRNA): post-transcriptional regulation, RNA silencing
            Small interfering RNA (siRNA): RNA silencing
            Small nuclear RNA (snRNA): processes pre-mRNA => mRNA
            Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA): processes pre-mRNA => mRNA
        Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
