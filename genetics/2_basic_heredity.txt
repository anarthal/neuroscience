LOCUS: position of a gene in a Chromosome
Two individuals are HOMOZYGOUS if their alleles are the same for phenotype, otherwise HETEROZYGOUS
Methodology
    Ensure homozygous for each trait: self-breed, then leave it grow for 2 generations
    Cross plants with != phenotypes, then self-cross
    Obtains 1/4, 3/4 of each phenotype
Conclusions (Mendel's 1st law)
    F1 (gen 1) get alleles from both parents
    Gametes separated
    Dominant allele (Y), recessive allele (y)
    Gametes form from alleles that segregate randomly with equal probability
TESTCROSS: cross dominant with recessive, observe the ratio
Dominance is not universal: phenotypes may merge
DIHYBRID cross: cross two purebreeds with 2 != phenotypes
    PUNNET SQUARE: place gamets on the sides, calculate the ratios
    Conclusion: different genes segregate independently (Mendel's 2nd law)
Calculate ratios: as the probability of independent events
    FORKED-LIKE method: diagram
Ratios may deviate from the expected: may be random or not
    Chi square test to verify statistical significance
GAMETES: reproductive cells in organisms that reproduce sexually
