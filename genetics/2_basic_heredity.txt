GAMETES: reproductive cells in organisms that reproduce sexually
Published 1865~, rediscovered 1990
Two individuals are HOMOZYGOUS if their alleles are the same for phenotype, otherwise HETEROZYGOUS
    Ensure an individual is homozygous: self-breed, then leave it grow for 2 generations
Mendel's 1st law: principle of equal segregation
    MONOHYBRID CROSS: cross specimens varying a single characteristic
    Cross pure-breeding (F1), then self-cross => 3:1 ratio
    Diploid organisms contain 2 alleles for each characteristic. Segregate in equal proportions when gametes are formed
    DOMINANCE: for heterozygous individuals, only the dominant allele expresses via the phenotype
        Not universal: for some alleles, heterozygous individuals present an intermediate phenotype
    Testcross: cross dominant unknown with recessive. Ratio 1:1
Mendel's 2nd law: principal of independent assortment. Alleles of different genes segregate independently of each other
    DIHYBRID cross: cross two purebreeds with 2 != phenotypes
    Dihybrid cross (F1) + self-cross (F2), yields ratio 9:3:3:1
    PUNNET SQUARE: place gamets on the sides, calculate the ratios
    FORKED-LIKE method: diagram
Ratios may deviate from the expected: may be random or not
    Chi square test to verify statistical significance
