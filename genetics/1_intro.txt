GENOME: complete set of genetic instructions. Different life forms, similar genetic mechanisms
EVOLUTION: gradual change of a population's genetic composition for adaptability
    LAST UNIVERSAL COMMON ANCESTOR (LUCA): common to all current life forms, the reason why mechanisms for genetics is so similar
    PROKARYOTES: simple, unicellular
        BACTERIA belong here
        ARCHAEA: unicellular, in-between, some processes more similar to eukaryotes
        Genetic material is in contact with other cell components (no nuclear membrane)
    EUKARYOTES: more complex
        May be uni or multi cellular
        Has nuclear membrane surrounding genetic material and organelles
    VIRUS: simpler, doesn't have cell structure. Not considered living beings
    3 domain theory: bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes: archaea and euokaryotes descend from bacteria
    2 domain theory: bacteria, (archaea + eukaryotes): bacteria => archaea => euokaryotes
GENOTYPE: internal hereditary factors
PHENOTYPE: external expression, influenced by genotype + environment. Only the genotype is inherited
ALLELES: variability in genetic material within the same species
    DISCONTINUOUS variation: discrete phenotype, 1-1 relationship to genotype
    CONTINUOUS variation: continuous phenotype, influenced by many genotypes and environment
    NORM OF REACTION: set of phenotypes that arise from changing the env, keeping genotype constant (e.g. plants). No uncoditional better genotype, depends on env. No knowledge of norm of reaction in humans
    WILD TYPE: the most common
Model genetic organisms: good to experiment in lab
GMO: genetic modified organisms, e.g. corn
Medicine: predict hereditary diseases
    MONOGENIC disease: rare, little env influence => easy to predict, BRCA1 gene mutation => breast cancer
    POLYGENIC disease: common, strong env influence
    Treatments: e.g. introduce insuline gene into bacteria to produce it
    Gene therapy: correct a mutant gene, underdeveloped yet
History
    Lamarck: acquired traits are inherited, unused characteristics are not transmitted. No longer accepted
    Blending inheritance: traits mixed
    Cell theory: cell is the fundamental unit. Cell come from pre-existing cells
    Chromosome theory: TBC
