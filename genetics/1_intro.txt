GENOME: complete set of genetic instructions
Forms of life
    LUCA: Last Universal Common Ancestor, the reason why mechanisms for genetics is so similar
    PROKARYOTES: simple, unicellular, doesn't have nuclear membrane
        BACTERIA: 
        ARCHAEA
    EUKARYOTES: multicellular. Has nucleus surrounding genetic material
    VIRUS: simpler, doesn't have cell structure
Fields of study
GENOTYPE: internal hereditary factors
PHENOTYPE: external expression, influenced by genotype, not all hereditary
ALLELES: variability in genetic material within the same species
    DISCONTINUOUS variation: discrete phenotype, 1-1 relationship to genotype
    CONTINUOUS variation: continuous phenotype, influenced by many genotypes and environment
    NORM OF REACTION: set of phenotypes that arise from changing the env, keeping genotype constant (e.g. plants). No uncoditional better genotype, depends on env. No knowledge of norm of reaction in humans
    WILD TYPE: the most common
Model genetic organisms: good to experiment in lab
GMO: genetic modified organisms, e.g. corn
Medicine: predict hereditary diseases
    MONOGENIC disease: rare, little env influence => easy to predict, BRCA1 gene mutation => breast cancer
    POLYGENIC disease: common, strong env influence
    Treatments: e.g. introduce insuline gene into bacteria to produce it
    Gene therapy: correct a mutant gene, underdeveloped yet
History
    Lamarck: acquired traits are inherited, unused characteristics are not transmitted. No longer accepted
    Blending inheritance: traits mixed
    Cell theory: cell is the fundamental unit. Cell come from pre-existing cells
    Chromosome theory: TBC
