Background
    GENE FAMILY: a set of != but very similar genes, generated by duplication of a common ancestor gene
    ALTERNATIVE SPLICING: combining exons of a single gene differently to generate != proteins with a single gene
Composition
    Genes & related sequences: 25%
        Coding region (EXON): fragments that encode proteins (present in pre-mRNA and mRNA)
        Non-coding region
            UTR: untranslated region
                Transcribed to mRNA and used by ribosomes as bind point (recruitment), but not translated
                Makes mRNA more stable
            INTRON: removed in mRNA. Regulate expression, encode for alternative splicing (protein diversity)
            PROMOTER: initiate transcription. Recognized by RNA polymerase and TF
            ENHANCER: regulates the expression of a gene. Recognized by TFs. Can be far away from the gene
            PSEUDOGENES: sequences that resemble genes, but are "malformed" (not functional), e.g. because replication error
    Intergenic sequences: 75%
        Low repetition: regulatory sequences (e.g. miRNA)
        High repetition
            INTERSPERSED REPEAT: scattered through genome. Generated by transposition
                LINE (long interspersed nuclear element): e.g. LINE-1, regulatory
                SINE (short interspersed nuclear element): e.g. Alu, regulatory
                LTR (long terminal repeats): flank endogenous retroviral DNA. Leftovers with no infection capabilities
            TANDEM REPEAT: a short sequence of nucleotides that repeat consecutively. Forms satellites
                Satellite: repeats of ~100bp. Centromeres
                Minisatellites: <25bp. Telomers
                Microsatellites/short tandem repeats (STR): <6bp. Num repeats variable within individuals => Profiling (TBC)
Gene structure
    Upstream: 5' end. Downstream: 3' end
    Transcriptional unit: upstream UTR + exons + introns + downstream UTR
    Upstream flanking region: (maybe) enhancer and promoter
    Downstream flanking region: (maybe) enhancer
Biological complexity
    C-VALUE: total size of the genome
    GENE DENSITY: num genes / total DNA
    C-value paradox: greater C-value, greater number of genes =!> greater complexity
        Complexity increases when gene density decreases: non-coding material. E.g. introns and protein diversity
Genome evolution: constantly changing with random processes
    Gene mutation (exon): changes the structure of the produced protein
    Regulatory DNA mutation: changes how much, when and where the protein is produced
    Gene duplication and divergence: creates gene families
    Exon shuffling: genes exchange exons. Changes gene functionality
    Transposition: element changes position. Depends on where it's inserted. LINE-1, Alu can transpose.
    Horizontal transfer: exchange of genetic material by individuals of the same generation, then inherited (mainly bacteria)
        Transformation: DNA from surroundings (e.g. other dead bacteria)
        Transduction: DNA from another individual packaged in a virion's DNA (e.g. phage)
        Conjugation: two individuals in contact exchange DNA
