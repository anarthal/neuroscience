Background
    HETEROMORPHIC CHROMOSOMES: a set of chromosomes with some homology but different shape and size
    AUTOSOME: chromosome that is not a sex chromosome. In diploid individuals, has an homologous
    TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR: protein that controls how much a gene transcribes
BIOLOGICAL SEX: phenotype determining the type of gametes (male: smaller, female: larger) an individual produces
Sex determined by
    CHROMOSOMAL: sex is determined by a set of heteromorphic (sex) chromosomes
        XX/XO: males 1X, females 2X. Females X gametes (homogametic sex), males X and O (heterogametic). Grasshoppers
        ZZ/ZW: males ZZ, females ZW. Female if W present. Birds, reptiles...
        XX/XY: males XY, females XX
        X:A ratio (special case of XX/XY) (e.g. drosophila): (num X chromosomes) / (num autosomal sets)
            X:A == 0.5 (e.g. XY, but not necessarily) => male
            X:A == 1.0 (e.g. XX) => female
            X:A between (0.5, 1.0) => intersex
            X:A > 1.0 => metafemale (sterile)
            X:A < 0.5 => metamale (sterile)
            Sex not directly determined by autosomes, but these influence indirectly (development process)
    GENIC: sex in autosomal chromosomes. Plants, fungi
    Environmental: sex is determined by individual's life cycle
        Sequential hermaphroditism: can be both male and female, but not at the same time
        Turtles: depending on egg water temperature
PSEUDOAUTOSOMAL REGION: small automsomal regions present in sex chromosomes, where recombination happens during meiosis
    At telomeres. Primary: top of the chromosome. Secondary: bottom
In humans
    General rules
        One X chromosome required for development
        Male genes located in Y
        Fertility in X and Y. Fertile females require XX
        > 2X => affects development
    Syndromes
        Turner syndrome: XO females. Sterile, normal development, underdeveloped secondary sex traits
        Klinefelter syndrome: XXY males. Sterile, normal development, underdeveloped secondary sex traits
        Poly X: females. Sterile, development problems
        XYY males: generally normal
    Mechanism
        TDF (Testis-determining factor): protein that causes primordial gonads to differentiate into testes
            Effect on early development (6 weeks fetus)
            Testes then produces testosterone (secondary sex traits), Anti-MÃ¼llerian (degenerates female ducts)
        SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) gene: located in non-autosomal region of chromosome Y, expresses by producing TDF
            XY females: not present in Y. Primordial gonads become ovaries
            XX males: present in X (crossover)
        TFM (Testicular Feminization Mutation) gene (in X): needs to be unaltered for correct male development
            Testes produce testosterone => Receptors => Nucleus => Transcription factor for required genes
            TFM mutation: no testosterone receptors => Female traits
