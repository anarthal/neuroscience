Background
    HETEROMORPHIC CHROMOSOMES: a set of chromosomes with some homology but different shape and size
    AUTOSOME: chromosome that is not a sex chromosome. In diploid individuals, has an homologous
    TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR: protein that controls how much a gene transcribes
BIOLOGICAL SEX: phenotype determining the type of gametes (male: smaller, female: larger) an individual produces
Sex determined by
    CHROMOSOMAL: sex is determined by a set of heteromorphic (sex) chromosomes
        XX/XO: males 1X, females 2X. Females X gametes (homogametic sex), males X and O (heterogametic). Grasshoppers
        ZZ/ZW: males ZZ, females ZW. Female if W present. Birds, reptiles...
        XX/XY: males XY, females XX
        X:A ratio (special case of XX/XY) (e.g. drosophila): (num X chromosomes) / (num autosomal sets)
            X:A == 0.5 (e.g. XY, but not necessarily) => male
            X:A == 1.0 (e.g. XX) => female
            X:A between (0.5, 1.0) => intersex
            X:A > 1.0 => metafemale (sterile)
            X:A < 0.5 => metamale (sterile)
            Sex not directly determined by autosomes, but these influence indirectly (development process)
    GENIC: sex in autosomal chromosomes. Plants, fungi
    Environmental: sex is determined by individual's life cycle
        Sequential hermaphroditism: can be both male and female, but not at the same time
        Turtles: depending on egg water temperature
PSEUDOAUTOSOMAL REGION: small automsomal regions present in sex chromosomes, where recombination happens during meiosis
    At telomeres. Primary: top of the chromosome. Secondary: bottom
In humans
    General rules
        One X chromosome required for development
        Male genes located in Y
        Fertility in X and Y. Fertile females require XX
        > 2X => affects development
    Syndromes
        Turner syndrome: XO females. Sterile, normal development, underdeveloped secondary sex traits
        Klinefelter syndrome: XXY males. Sterile, normal development, underdeveloped secondary sex traits
        Poly X: females. Sterile, development problems
        XYY males: generally normal
    Mechanism
        TDF (Testis-determining factor): protein that causes primordial gonads to differentiate into testes
            Effect on early development (6 weeks fetus)
            Testes then produces testosterone (secondary sex traits), Anti-MÃ¼llerian (degenerates female ducts)
        SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) gene: located in non-autosomal region of chromosome Y, expresses by producing TDF
            XY females: not present in Y. Primordial gonads become ovaries
            XX males: present in X (crossover)
        TFM (Testicular Feminization Mutation) gene (in X): needs to be unaltered for correct male development
            Testes produce testosterone => Receptors => Nucleus => Transcription factor for required genes
            TFM mutation: no testosterone receptors => Female traits
X/Y-LINKAGE: applies to a gene that is present in the non-autosomal regions of X or Y
    Inheritance doesn't follow Mendelian ratios. Gene dependent on the individual's sex
    HEMIZYGOUS individual for a gene: diploid, but has only one copy of the gene (X/Y linkage)
    X has >> genes than Y. Y mostly male-specific genes
    E.g. color blindness X-linked recessive => More common in men
SEX-LIMITED INHERITANCE: autosomal gene (present in both sexes) expressed only in one sex. E.g. breast/beard development
SEX-INFLUENCED INHERITANCE: phenotype influenced by sex (but not limited to it). E.g. premature baldness, expresses more in men
DOSAGE COMPENSATION of X-linked genes: process of equalizing gene expression across sexes that have != number of sex chromosomes
    Females 2X, and protein synthesis depends on num X => Mechanism to compensate
    Mechanisms
        Hypertranscription (drosophila): males increase activity of their X
        Hypotranscription: females reduce each X activity to 1/2
        Inactivation (mammals): females inactivate one of their X
    Inactivation
        BARR BODY: inactivated X chromosome
        Random in most mammals except marsupials
        Happens early in development (humans: first weeks)
        Once an instance of X is inactivated, remains inactive in the cell and its descendants
        MOSAICISM: not all cells inactivate the same X instance, but neighbors do => Patchy pattern in cats
            In females, 50% cells produce paternal proteins, 50% maternal. Never both
            Females functionally hemizygous with respect to X-linked genes
        Only 75-85% of genes are permanently inactivated => XXX females != XX females
        Triggered by X-INACTIVATION CENTER gene, expressed in the X to be inactivated (Xi)
        X-INACTIVE SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPT (Xist): lncRNA that coats Xi and inhibits expression
