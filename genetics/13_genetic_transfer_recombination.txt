Background
    RecA: protein involved in bacterial DNA repair
Mechanism of horizontal transfer
    TRANSFORMATION: DNA acquired from surroundings (e.g. other dead bacteria)
        COMPETENT bacteria: one that is able to take DNA through transformation
        Naturally competent: competent in nature (vs. in the lab)
    TRANSDUCTION: DNA from another individual packaged in a virion's DNA (e.g. phage)
        LYTIC CYCLE: virus DNA is outside the host's chromosome, replicates and ends up with lysis
            Attachment: phage attaches to cell wall
            Penetration: phage inserts DNA
            Biosynthesis: phage hijacks machinery and synthesizes components
            Maturation: new phages are assembled from components
            Lysis: cell dies
        LYSOGENIC CYCLE: virus DNA integrates in the host's chromosome and replicates with it
            Some phages insert at certain positions only
            Does not cause immediate death
            Can change to lytic cycle under certain environment conditions (e.g. unfavorable for bacterium)
            PROPHAGE: phage DNA integrated into the host's chromosome
        Generalized transduction: fragment of host DNA packaged by error in a capside, after lytic cycle
            All DNA sequences in the host have the same probability to transduct
        Specialized transduction: fragment of host DNA excised by error after lysogenic => lytic
            Sequences close to the insertion point have higher probability to transduct
    Conjugation: two individuals in contact exchange DNA

Introgression: exchange of info across species via crosses and hybrids, common in plants
Conjugation: insertion of a plasmid inside the other bacteria
    Plasmid: independent replicon, independent from the main chromosome with the ability to replicate
    Plasmid replicates using rolling circle
    Each plasmid has a stable number of copies in each bacteria
restriction enzyme: cut DNA at particular, well-known sequences
    recognizes a sequence and performs 2 nicks, one in each strand, at != positions inside the recognized sequence
polylinker: 
Selectable marker: DNA genes that indicate that the event of interest happened.
    E.g. did my bacteria capture the DNA I introduced?
    E.g. if this was the resistance for antibiotic X plasmid, we can know the ones that took our DNA because they die with antibiotic X
    You need these because Pr(plasmid takes DNA and integrates in the bacteria) is very low
High frequence of recombination (Hfr)
what's the benefit for the donor bacteria?
    bacteria are populations - it's beneficial for the population
    it's beneficial for the plasmid because it's replicating
