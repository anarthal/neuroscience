Background
    RecA: protein involved in bacterial DNA repair
    ENDOSYMBIOTIC: symbiotic organism that lives within its host
    INTROGRESSION: exchange of info across species via crosses and hybrids, common in plants
Mechanism of horizontal transfer
    TRANSFORMATION: DNA acquired from surroundings (e.g. other dead bacteria)
        COMPETENT bacteria: one that is able to take DNA through transformation
        Naturally competent: competent in nature (vs. in the lab)
    TRANSDUCTION: DNA from another individual packaged in a virion's DNA (e.g. phage)
        LYTIC CYCLE: virus DNA is outside the host's chromosome, replicates and ends up with lysis
            Attachment: phage attaches to cell wall
            Penetration: phage inserts DNA
            Biosynthesis: phage hijacks machinery and synthesizes components
            Maturation: new phages are assembled from components
            Lysis: cell dies
        LYSOGENIC CYCLE: virus DNA integrates in the host's chromosome and replicates with it
            Some phages insert at certain positions only
            Does not cause immediate death
            Can change to lytic cycle under certain environment conditions (e.g. unfavorable for bacterium)
            PROPHAGE: phage DNA integrated into the host's chromosome
        Generalized transduction: fragment of host DNA packaged by error in a capside, after lytic cycle
            All DNA sequences in the host have the same probability to transduct
        Specialized transduction: fragment of host DNA excised by error after lysogenic => lytic
            Sequences close to the insertion point have higher probability to transduct
    CONJUGATION: two individuals in contact exchange DNA, usually as plasmids
        PLASMID: small piece of circular dsDNA living in the cytoplasm of bacteria. Can replicate independently
            Endosymbiotic with bacteria: encode for resistance (e.g. antibiotics), virulence... and plasmid gets to replicate
            Mobilizable: has an origin of transfer so it can be nicked and transferred
        Pilus: tubule connecting two bacteria to conjugate
        Each plasmid has a stable number of copies in each bacterium
        Plasmids may integrate in the host chromosome or not
        HIGH-FREQUENCY RECOMBINATION CELL: bacterium with integrated plasmid
        Plasmids can be used for genetic engineering
            CLONING VECTOR: piece of DNA that can be maintained in an organism, to which foreign DNA can be added
            MULTIPLE CLONING SITE/POLYLINKER: segment of cloning vector containing multiple, unique restriction sites
            SELECTABLE MARKER: reporter gene introduced with the genes of interest that can be used to select bacteria
                Did my plasmid integrate the DNA I provided? Only the ones that took the gene are antibiotic resistant
