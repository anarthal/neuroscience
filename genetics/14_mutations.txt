MUTATION: stable, heritable change in genetic info. In cells or organisms
    Random: they are not a response to selection pressure. Most cases => loss of meaning => diseases
Types according to the type of cell where it happens
    Somatic: happens in a somatic cell => affect daughter cells in the individual, but not progeny
    Germ-line: happens in cells producing gametes => may affect progeny
Types according size
    Molecular/gene: small change in nucleotides. Affects one gene
        1. POINT MUTATION/base substitution: single bp changed. Affects single codon
            TRANSITION: purine <=> purine, pyrimidine <=> pyrimidine. More frequent, less consequences
            TRANSVERSION: purine <=> pyrimidine
        2. Small insertion/deletion (INDELs): more frequent than point mutations. Change reading frame.
    Chromosomal: large portion of chromosome altered. Affects several genes
    Genomic: alteration in number of chromosomes. Affects all genes
Results at molecular level
    SILENT/SYNONYMOUS: new codon specifies same amino acid. May still affect regulator binding and splice points
    MISSENSE CONSERVATIVE/NEUTRAL: new codon specifies similar amino acid. Silent consequences + != protein folding, cofactors...
    MISSENSE NON-CONSERVATIVE: new codon specifies very != amino acid. != protein
    NONSENSE: new codon specifies stop. != protein
    FRAMESHIFT (INDELs): != protein
Functional results
    Loss-of-function: WT function lost
    Gain-of-function: silent WT function expressed
    Conditional: only expressed under certain env conditions
SUPPRESSOR: mutation that reverses another mutation
    Intragenic: in the same gene. E.g. in the same codon, so the mutation becomes silent
    Intergenic: in != gene. E.g. change in tRNA so stop codon changes meaning
