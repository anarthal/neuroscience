Background
    TAUTOMERS: isomers that inter-convert quickly. Usually != in a H atom
    BASE-EXCISION REPAIR: system to repair incorrect pairings and small base losses
    ALKANE: CHi chain where all bonds are single (saturated)
    ALKYL: alkane missing a hydrogen
    HAPLO-INSUFFICIENT: gene that requires 2 working copies to work correctly
    Transposons are the most common source of mutations
MUTATION: stable, heritable change in genetic info. In cells or organisms
    Random: they are not a response to selection pressure. Most cases => loss of meaning => diseases
Types according to the type of cell where it happens
    Somatic: happens in a somatic cell => affect daughter cells in the individual, but not progeny
    Germ-line: happens in cells producing gametes => may affect progeny
Types according size
    Molecular/gene: small change in nucleotides. Affects one gene
        POINT MUTATION/base substitution: single bp changed. Affects single codon
            TRANSITION: purine <=> purine, pyrimidine <=> pyrimidine. More frequent, less consequences
            TRANSVERSION: purine <=> pyrimidine
        Small insertion/deletion (INDELs): more frequent than point mutations. Change reading frame.
    Chromosomal: large portion of chromosome altered. Affects several genes
    Genomic: alteration in number of chromosomes. Affects all genes. E.g. aneuploidy, poliploidy
Results at molecular level
    SILENT/SYNONYMOUS: new codon specifies same amino acid. May still affect regulator binding and splice points
    MISSENSE CONSERVATIVE/NEUTRAL: new codon specifies similar amino acid. Silent consequences + != protein folding, cofactors...
    MISSENSE NON-CONSERVATIVE: new codon specifies very != amino acid. != protein
    NONSENSE: new codon specifies stop. != protein
    FRAMESHIFT (INDELs): != protein
Functional results
    Loss-of-function: WT function lost
    Gain-of-function: silent WT function expressed
    Conditional: only expressed under certain env conditions
SUPPRESSOR: mutation that reverses another mutation
    Intragenic: in the same gene. E.g. in the same codon, so the mutation becomes silent
    Intergenic: in != gene. E.g. change in tRNA so stop codon changes meaning
TAUTOMERIC SHIFTS: spontaneous mutation cause, during replication. Cause base point mutations
    Bases exist in usual form (e.g. A) and tautomer (A*). [A] >>> [A*]
    Tautomer may still be incorporated in rare cases
    Tautomer pairs with != base (the other purine/pyrimidine => transition) => Incorporated error
    If replication happens before repair => Incorrect pairing inherited, no way to correct it => Replicated error
INCORRECT ALIGNMENT: spontaneous mutation cause, during replication. Causes INDELs
    In repeated sequences
    Synthesized strand loops out => Double replication of bp => Insertion
    Template strand loops out => Skipping of bp => Deletion
DEPURINATION: loss of a purine by severing the sugar-base bond. May be spontaneous or induced
    If not repaired by BER, during replication => Random base selected in the empty space (usually A)
DEAMINATION: loss of a NH2 group from a base => Transformed into a != base with != pairing
MUTAGEN: env factor that may cause a mutation
    Chemical
        BASE ANALOGS: chemicals with similar structure as bases
            During synthesis, polymerase may mistake them for bases and incorporate them
            Have != pairing properties than bases => Mispairing
        ALKYLATING AGENTS: donate alkyl groups to bases => Mispairing
        DEAMINATING AGENTS: induce deamination. E.g. nitrous acid
        HYDROXYLATION CAUSING AGENTS: change amine into hydroxyl-amine => Mispairing
        INTERCALATING AGENTS: planar molecules that insert between bps and distort the helix => INDELs after replication
        OXIDATIVE RADICALS: donates oxygens to bps => Mispairing. E.g. H2O2
    Physical
        IONIZING RADIATION: capable of dislodging electrons from molecules
            Directly break phosphodiester bonds => Double strand breaks
            Ionize other molecules into reactive radicals that react with DNA
            Repairing breaks => chromosome mutations
            E.g. α particles, β particles, γ rays, X-rays
        UV radiation (non-ionizing): forms bonds between pyrimidines (pyrimidine dimmers)
            Block replication, can lead to repair errors
Chromosome rearrangements: change the structure of a chromosome
    Origin
        Double-strand breaks: since they're severe, they're repaired ASAP, not always correctly
        Unequal crossover: chromosomes incorrectly aligned
    Duplication
        Reverse: a segment is copied and inverted
        Displaced: a segment is copied far away from the original
        Tandem: a segment is copied near the original
        Retroposition: a segment transcribed, retrotranscribed, inserted
        Effects
            Change in relative genetic dosage
            May affect genetic regulation (change in structure)
            Problems with mitosis/meiotic pairing (!= chromosome structure than homologue)
    Deletion
        Terminal: the end is deleted
        Intersticial: an intermediate segment is deleted
        Effects
            Centromere deletion => Doesn't segregate when dividing => Chromosomal loss
            Homozygous => Lethal, no required products generated
            Heterozygous
                Imbalance in gene products
                PSEUDODOMINANCE: expression of recessive mutations, because dominant allele was deleted
                Haplo-insufficient genes cause problems
    Inversion: a segment is rotated 180º and re-attached
        Pericentric: includes the centromere
        Paracentric: doesn't include the centromere
        Position effects: changes genetic regulation, can truncate genes
    TRANSLOCATION: a piece of chromosome moves
        Reciprocal: two segments exchanged
        Robertsonian: one chromosome attached to the end of another one
        Position effects: changes genetic regulation, can truncate genes
ANEUPLOIDY: change in the number of chromosomes for an individual homologue set
    Nullisomy/monosomy/trisomy/tetrasomy: having 0/1/3/4 copies of an homologue pair
    Alters genetic dosage, lethal/affect development
    Caused by meiosis I, meiosis II or mitosis (mosaicism) non-disjunction
POLIPLOIDY: addition of one or more copies to each chromosome set
    ALLOPOLYPLOIDY: poliploidy caused by hybridization (!= species crossed)
    AUTOPOLIPLOIDY: poliploidy caused by accidents in mitosis/meiosis (cells don't separate). Only 1 species involved
    Common in plants: non-chromosomal sex determination, vegetative reproduction, insect pollination leads to hybridization
