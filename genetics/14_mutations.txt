Background
    TAUTOMERS: isomers that inter-convert quickly. Usually != in a H atom
    BASE-EXCISION REPAIR: system to repair incorrect pairings and small base losses
    ALKANE: CHi chain where all bonds are single (saturated)
    ALKYL: alkane missing a hydrogen
MUTATION: stable, heritable change in genetic info. In cells or organisms
    Random: they are not a response to selection pressure. Most cases => loss of meaning => diseases
Types according to the type of cell where it happens
    Somatic: happens in a somatic cell => affect daughter cells in the individual, but not progeny
    Germ-line: happens in cells producing gametes => may affect progeny
Types according size
    Molecular/gene: small change in nucleotides. Affects one gene
        1. POINT MUTATION/base substitution: single bp changed. Affects single codon
            TRANSITION: purine <=> purine, pyrimidine <=> pyrimidine. More frequent, less consequences
            TRANSVERSION: purine <=> pyrimidine
        2. Small insertion/deletion (INDELs): more frequent than point mutations. Change reading frame.
    Chromosomal: large portion of chromosome altered. Affects several genes
    Genomic: alteration in number of chromosomes. Affects all genes
Results at molecular level
    SILENT/SYNONYMOUS: new codon specifies same amino acid. May still affect regulator binding and splice points
    MISSENSE CONSERVATIVE/NEUTRAL: new codon specifies similar amino acid. Silent consequences + != protein folding, cofactors...
    MISSENSE NON-CONSERVATIVE: new codon specifies very != amino acid. != protein
    NONSENSE: new codon specifies stop. != protein
    FRAMESHIFT (INDELs): != protein
Functional results
    Loss-of-function: WT function lost
    Gain-of-function: silent WT function expressed
    Conditional: only expressed under certain env conditions
SUPPRESSOR: mutation that reverses another mutation
    Intragenic: in the same gene. E.g. in the same codon, so the mutation becomes silent
    Intergenic: in != gene. E.g. change in tRNA so stop codon changes meaning
TAUTOMERIC SHIFTS: spontaneous mutation cause, during replication. Cause base point mutations
    Bases exist in usual form (e.g. A) and tautomer (A*). [A] >>> [A*]
    Tautomer may still be incorporated in rare cases
    Tautomer pairs with != base (the other purine/pyrimidine => transition) => Incorporated error
    If replication happens before repair => Incorrect pairing inherited, no way to correct it => Replicated error
INCORRECT ALIGNMENT: spontaneous mutation cause, during replication. Causes INDELs
    In repeated sequences
    Synthesized strand loops out => Double replication of bp => Insertion
    Template strand loops out => Skipping of bp => Deletion
DEPURINATION: loss of a purine by severing the sugar-base bond. May be spontaneous or induced
    If not repaired by BER, during replication => Random base selected in the empty space (usually A)
DEAMINATION: loss of a NH2 group from a base => Transformed into a != base with != pairing
MUTAGEN: env factor that may cause a mutation
    Chemical
        BASE ANALOGS: chemicals with similar structure as bases
            During synthesis, polymerase may mistake them for bases and incorporate them
            Have != pairing properties than bases => Mispairing
        ALKYLATING AGENTS: donate alkyl groups to bases => Mispairing
        DEAMINATING AGENTS: induce deamination. E.g. nitrous acid
        HYDROXYLATION CAUSING AGENTS: change amine into hydroxyl-amine => Mispairing
        INTERCALATING AGENTS: planar molecules that insert between bps and distort the helix => INDELs
        OXIDATIVE RADICALS: donates oxygens to bps => Mispairing. E.g. H2O2
    Physical
        IONIZING RADIATION: capable of dislodging electrons from molecules
            Directly break phosphodiester bonds => Double strand breaks
            Ionize other molecules into reactive radicals that react with DNA
            Repairing breaks => chromosome mutations
            E.g. α particles, β particles, γ rays, X-rays
        UV radiation (non-ionizing): forms bonds between pyrimidines (pyrimidine dimmers)
            Block replication, can lead to repair errors
