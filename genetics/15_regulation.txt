Background
    Gene expressed CONSTITUTIVELY: expressed continuously by default (vs. facultatively)
    METABOLITE: molecule (usually small) product of metabolism
    PALINDROME: sequence that reads the same in the template and complementary strands (5'->3'). Equal to its reverse complement
    ALLOSTERIC REGULATOR: molecule that binds to an enzyme/protein => conformation change => change in activity
    LEADER SEQUENCE: 5' UTR of mRNA
Regulation points
    (Eukaryotes) before transcription: epigenetics
    (All) transcription factors
    (Eukaryotes) alternate RNA splicing
    (Eukaryotes) RNA transport efficiency
    (All) RNA stability
    (All) Translation efficiency
    (Prokaryotes) Coupled transcription and translation
Regulation circuits
    INDUCTION: activation of the expression of a gene that is off at basal levels
    REPRESSION: deactivation of the expression of a gene that is on at basal levels
    ACTIVATOR: DNA binding molecule that enables the expression of a gene
    REPRESSOR: DNA binding molecule that inhibits the expression of a gene
    INDUCER: molecule that interacts with an activator/repressor to produce induction
    COREPRESSOR: molecule that interacts with an activator/repressor to produce repression
    POSITIVE CONTROL: control mechanism that acts using an activator
    NEGATIVE CONTROL: control mechanism that acts using a repressor
    Induction by positive control: in basal state, gene off. Inducer + activator => Induction
    Induction by negative control: in basal state, gene off because of repressor. Inactivating the repressor makes it express.
    Repression by positive control: in basal state, gene on because of activator. Inactivating the activator represses it.
    Repression by negative control: in basal state, gene on. Repressor + corepressor => Repression
Control elements
    REGULATOR GENE: gene that encodes a product that performs regulation. Vs. structural gene
    REGULATOR SEQUENCE: DNA segment where a regulator product binds
    CIS-ACTING elements: DNA segments on the same molecule as the genes they regulate. E.g. promoter, enhancer, silencer, operator
    TRANS-ACTING elements: products (and genes encoding them) that regulate genes by interacting with cis-acting elements. Usually RNA/proteins. May act on any copy of its target DNA
OPERON (mostly prokaryotes): DNA sequence containing a single promoter/operator followed by several genes, sharing control sequence.
    All/no genes transcribed.
    a. Promoter
    b. Operator: control sequence, downstream the promoter, to which a trans control element (repressor or activator) binds. Physically linked to the structural genes (vs. enhancers)
    c. Structural genes 
    E.g. operon lac only expressed when lactose present: metabolite of lactose => inducer => inactivates repressor => induction by negative control
    E.g. operon lac only expressed when no glucose present: no glucose => inducer => activates activator => induction by positive control
    E.g. operon trp expressed when no tryptophan: repressor activated by tryptophan => repression by negative control
ATTENUATION (prokaryotes): termination of transcription before structural genes by an interference of translation
    E.g. operon trp has leader sequences containing trp, causing termination if trp is available
TWO COMPONENT SYSTEMS (mostly prokaryotes)
    Sensor kinase: transmembrane protein that senses changes in the environment
    Response regulator: phosphorylated by sensor kinase on activation. Triggers regulation




distal elements may affect the expression of more than one gene
LCR = big enhancer that controls multiple genes. != is that it recruits chromatin-modifying elements
DNA binding domain: identifies where to bind (the only one critical)
sensor domain => identifies stimulus
activating domain => performs actual activation
terapeutic target: a molecule, receptor, enzyme... you want to modify when a cell is sick. E.g. for diabetes, insulin
ligands (?): something that can bind to your terapeutic target
reporter gene: one whose product is very easy to see
DNA binding domain: usually +ively charged, and interact with major groove
