Background
    SUPERCOILING: further twisting of DNA. Can cause the helix to knot and change shape
        Positive: twisting right-handedly (increasing the amount of twist)
        Negative: un-twisting
    POLYMERASE: enzyme that synthesizes polymer chains
    NUCLEOSIDE: a nucleotide without the phosphate group
    NTP (nucleoside triphosphate): a nucleoside + 3 phosphate groups. Precursor of ADN/ARN molecules
        dNTP: deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphate
        rNTP or just NTP: ribose nucleoside triphosphate
Initial models
    Conservative: double strand replicated as-is. Not real
    Dispersive: fragments of double strand replicated as-is, then re-assembled. Not real
    Semi-conservative: strands separate and replicate. Each child helix has 1 strand from parent. Real
DNA TOPOISOMERASE: enzyme that catalyzes DNA topological changes (e.g. undoing supercoils)
    Type I: nick in a single strand
        Type IA: the intact strand passes through the nick
        Type IB: the broken strand is rotated around the intact strand
    Type II: nick in both strands
    DECATENATION: process of separating two circular DNA molecules, topologically linked after replication
Modes of replication
    ORIGIN OF REPLICATION: point in genome where replication starts. Not random
    REPLICATION FORKS: structure formed when the helix separates, where replication is actively taking place
        Either 1 or (usually) 2 replication forks, opposite directions from origin
    REPLICON: piece of DNA produced by a single replication origin
    REPLICATION BUBBLE: structure formed when the helix separates, contains 2 replication forks
    THETA REPLICATION (prokaryotes)
        Circular chromosome unwinds at single replication origin => Replication bubble
    LINEAR REPLICATION (eukaryotes)
        Replication rate is slower than prokaryotes and genome bigger => Parallelization
        Multiple replication origins with 2 forks, progress until fusing
Overall structure
    HELICASE: enzyme that breaks hydrogen bonds, splitting strands
    PRIMASE: synthesizes RNA primers, so polymerase can work
    DNA POLYMERASE: catalyzes synthesis, binding new nucleotides
        Only 5' to 3': adds dNTPs to the OH groups in 3'
        Requires a primer and a template strand
        LEADING STRAND (5' to 3'): synthesized continuously
        LAGGING STRAND (3' to 5'): synthesized in small fragments (OKAZAKI FRAGMENTS), starting with primer, 5' to 3'
    Primers replaced with RNA
    LIGASE: enzyme that seals DNA nicks
DNA polymerase
    Hand-like structure with 3 domains
        Palm: adding new nucleotides and verification
        Fingers: aid catalysis, close when correct nucleotide binds
        Thumb: attachment to DNA
    DNA-specific
    Eukaryotes
        Pol α: elongates primers created by primase
        Pol δ: lagging strand
        Pol ε: leading strand
    PROCESSIVITY: enzyme's ability to catalyze consecutive reactions (i.e. adding consecutive nucleotides) without binding
        Binding is slower than adding nucleotides => High processivity required for efficient synthesis
    Proofreading activity: can detect and correct errors to decrease error rate (1/10^5 => 1/10^7)
        Error => synthesis slows down, growing chain moves to exonuclease domain => Incorrect nucleotide removed
        Post-replication error correction => 1/10^10
