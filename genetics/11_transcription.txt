Background
    CONSENSUS SEQUENCE of a set of sequences: sequence containing the most common nucleotide for each analyzed position
        If conserved => important function
General features
    Direction 5' => 3' (adding nucleotides to 3' OH)
    Single stranded: no Okazaki fragments
    No primers needed
    Topoisomerases important
    Transcription rate slower
RNA polymerase
    Single enzyme that unwinds/rewinds DNA and synthesizes RNA
    Limited proofreading activity => More mistakes
    Crab claw structure
Naming conventions
    Upstream: 5' end. Downstream: 3' end
    Transcriptional unit: linear sequence of DNA that gets transcribed to RNA + sequences required for transcription
        Includes promoter + RNA coding region (UTRs, exons, introns), but not enhancer
        TRANSCRIPTION START SITE: 1st transcribed nucleotide. Position +1, increasing downstream
        TERMINATOR SITE: signals the end of the transcription
    Position of a sequence: indicates mid-point
    Control elements: regulate gene expression
        Proximal: located in the promoter
        Distal: Kb away. Silencers/enhancers
    Each gene always uses the same template strand
Phases
    1. Initiation: RNA polymerase binds, DNA unwinds, synthesis of nucleotides until leaving the promoter
    2. Elongation: actual synthesis
    3. Termination: polymerase reaches terminator sequence, RNA released, polymerase dissociates
Prokaryotic background
    OPERON (e.g. lac): DNA sequence containing a single promoter/operator followed by several genes, sharing control sequence.
        All/no genes transcribed.
        The repressor might be encoded by an upstream regulatory sequence
        a. Promoter
        b. Operator: control sequence, downstream the promoter, to which a repressor binds, blocking the path for RNA polymerase
        c. Structural genes
    Pribnow box (-10): part of the promoter. 1st bind point of polymerase, where transcription bubble forms
    SIGMA FACTOR: protein required to initiate transcription. f(gene)
    RNA polymerase holoenzyme: sigma factor + core RNA polymerase
In prokaryotes
    1. Initiation
        Sigma binds to core polymerase to form holoenzyme
        Holoenzyme binds to promoter consensus sequences
        DNA unwinds to form transcription bubble
        Polymerase starts synthesis
        Sigma factor released => No longer bound to consensus sequences
    3. Termination: two types of sequences
        Rho-independent
            Inverted, repeated sequences => Form hairpin that slows down and destabilizes
            Several consecutive A (weakest link)
        Rho-dependent: depends on rho protein
            Rho-utilization site (rut): point in RNA where rho binds
            Rho binds to rut and moves downstream
            Polymerase slows down => rho reaches it
            Rho has helicase activity => separates DNA from RNA
