Background
    DE NOVO MUTATION: appearing in an individual for the 1st time, not seen in previous generation
PEDIGREE ANALYSIS: chart-based analysis method to determine pattern of inheritance of a condition in humans (bc limited num offsprings)
Autosomal recessive (e.g. albinism, Tay-Sachs)
    Present in males and females
    Skips generations, parents not affected (heterozygotes)
    Common in consanguineous mating
    Tay-Sachs: mutation that prevents generation of hex-a enzyme => gangliosides accumulate => neuron degeneration
Autosomal dominant (e.g. Huntington - early neuronal degeneration)
    Present in males and females
    Doesn't skip generations
    Most of the affected individuals heterozygotes
    Healthy individuals do not transmit it
    Huntington: mutation in HTT gene that causes mutated (longer) huntingtin protein => Accumulates in neurons
X-linked recessive (e.g. haemophilia A => no blood clots)
    More common in men (hemizygous for X): women need 2 copies of mutant allele, men just 1
    Skips generations
    Affected woman => Sons affected, daughters carriers
    Carrier woman => 1/2 sons affected, 1/2 daughters carriers
    Affected man => Sons healthy, 1/2 daughters carriers
X-linked dominant (e.g. hypophosphatemia)
    More common in women (1 copy of X affected => affected), but symptoms more severe in men
    Does not skip generations (always an affected parent)
    Affected woman => 1/2 sons affected, 1/2 daughters affected
    Affected men => Sons healthy, all daughters affected
    Hipophosphatemia (vitamin D resistant rickets) => Vitamin D receptors affected => Reduced phosphate deposition in bones => Rickets
Y-linked traits (e.g. webbed toes)
    Only affect men
    Affected men have all sons affected
    Not too many, mostly related to fertility
