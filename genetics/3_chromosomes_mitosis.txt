Background
    MONOMER: molecule that can react with other molecules to compose a greater one (POLYMER)
    PENTOSE: monosaccharide with 5 carbons. e.g. ribose, 2'-deoxyribose
    N-TERMINAL: the "beginning" of a protein, an amine group (NH2-)
    C-TERMINAL: the "end" of a protein, a carboxylic group
    POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION: changes to a protein after it's been synthesized
    Protein DOMAIN: a region of a protein that self-stabilizes and folds independently of each other
History
    Mendel observed, no knowledge of why
    Sutton (~1900) rediscovers his work, postulates that genes reside in chromosomes
Nucleic acid structure
    NUCLEOTIDE BASE/NUCLEOBASE: nitrogen-based compound: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), guanine (G), uracil (U)
        DNA: ATCG
        RNA: AUCG
    COMPLEMENTARITY: each nucleobase binds to exactly one other: A <=> T/U C <=> G
    BASE PAIR (bp): fundamental unit of nuclear acid: two nucleobases bound together by a hydrogen bond
    NUCLEOTIDE: monomer formed by pentose + phosphate + nucleobase
        Nucleobases bind together in base pairs, base pairs bind via the phosphates (phosphodiester bonds)
        (Double) chain of nucleotides => ADN/ARN helix (~2nm ⌀)
CHROMOSOME: package of DNA containing part of an individual's genetic material. Visible only during mitosis/meiasis
    HISTONE: protein that helps packaging DNA
    CHROMATIN: complex of DNA + protein. Chromosomes are highly-packed chromatin
    NUCLEASE: enzyme that breaks phosphodiester bonds, splitting nucleotides
    ELECTROPHORESIS: method of separating charged molecules
        Apply an electric field with the molecules suspended in gel, so they move
        Distance traveled is smaller the bigger the molecule is
        Usually conducted within several lanes. Molecule weight size markers (known size) can be used to estimate unknown sizes
    NUCLEOSOME: basic subunit of chromatin
        Octamer of histones + 146bp DNA wrapping the octamer twice, spaced regularly every 200bp
        Nuclease protection experiment: treat DNA with nuclease, cutting away free DNA
            Limiting conditions: some free DNA ties are cut, others are not. Bands of N*200bp length => Regular spacing
            Non-limiting conditions: all free DNA ties are cut. All bands 146bp length => Length of DNA closely attached to histone
        LINKER DNA: free DNA that joins nucleosomes. May vary in length between species and cells
        Histone has N-terminal tails, undergo post-translational modifications when chromatin changes shape
        Histone has + charge
        Histone octamer: 2x (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) - histone variants
    BEADS ON A STRING: chromatin structure of nucleosomes + linker DNA (~11nm ⌀), loosely packed (~6-fold)
    30-NM FIBER: further condensation of beads-on-a-string (~40-fold)
        H1: histone that sits on top of nucleosome, binds to it and linker DNA. Compacts nucleosomes
        N-terminals interact with each other and stabilize the fiber
        CHROMATOSOME: nucleosome + H1 histone
        Exact structure unknown. Accepted that arrangement along helix axis. Several models
            Solenoid: the helix axis is hollow
            Zig-zag: linker DNA crosses the helix axis, makes more sense for longer linkers
    300-NM FIBER: higher-order structure, composed of scaffolding (non-histone proteins) + 30-nm fiber loops binding to it (looped domain)
    Metaphase CHROMOSOME: the tightest packed DNA structure (~10k fold)
        CHROMATID: each of the strands in a chromosome. Composed of packed 300-nm fiber (700nm)
        SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins: protein complexes that keep chromosomes together
            (???? is this true?) CONDENSIN: keep the 300-nm fiber loops that compose chromatids together
            COHESIN: keep sister chromatids together (along the whole chromosome)
    HETEROCHROMATIN: densely condensed chromatin, observable. Chromosomes composed of heterochromatin. More present during division
    EUCHROMATIN: relaxed state of chromatin, thin and difficult to observe. More present during the rest of cell cycle
