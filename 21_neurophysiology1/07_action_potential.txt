Conductance changes during AP because channels open
    Na+ high during depolarization, K+ high during repolarization
    Voltage clamp important to eliminate interaction between Na+ and K+ channels
Conductance changes with time
    Both Na+ and K+ channels open on depolarization => Increased conductance
    Na+ channels open rapidly and then inactivate
    K+ channels open slowly and don't inactivate
    Absolute refractory period caused by Na+ channel inactivation
    Relative refractory period caused by K+ channels still active and some Na+ channels still inactive
Passive electrical properties: determine how an electrical impulse spreads, without active regeneration involving ion channels
    Considering a cylindrical axon of radius r
    Membrane resistance (r_m): resistance of the axon membrane per unit of length. r_m ∝ 1/r
    Membrane capacitance (c_m): same, but for capacitance. c_m ∝ r
    Axial resistance (r_a): resistance of the axon's cytoplasm per unit of length. r_a ∝ 1/r²
Action potential velocity proportional to 1 / (r_a * c_m)
    Action potential spreads passively (electrotonically), except in sites where it's regenerated (e.g. nodes of Ranvier)
    Current in AP flows both forward and backward, but refractory period makes AP propagate only forward
    Axon diameter increases conduction speed: speed ∝ r
    Insulation (myelin) decreases c_m more efficiently than increasing the radius => increases speed
In long structures, voltage response caused by injected current decays with space
    AXON LENGTH CONSTANT (λ): length it takes for voltage to decay to 37% of its initial value
    λ = sqrt(r_m / r_a)
    Insulation (myelin) increases r_m => increases λ
Time constant τ = r_m * c_m: time it takes for the voltage step response to get to 63% of its final value
Threshold varies: the stronger the stimulus, the shorter the time it needs to be active to fire an AP
    RHEOBASE: minimum stimulus intensity that causes an AP when sustained for a very long period of time
    CRONAXIE: time period required by a stimulus with amplitude 2*rheobase to trigger an AP
