Tau: a microtubule-associated protein that regulates microtubule organization
    Different in axons than in dendrites
PROTOFILAMENT: microtubule dimer formed of an alpha and a beta tubulin
Microfilament functions
    Neuronal growth cone
    Formation of dendritic spines
    Synaptic plasticity
Fast transport: moves vesicles and organelles back and forth (mitochondria =>, vesicles =>, endosomes <=)
    Uses microtubules
    Also moves mRNAs =>, using bound proteins, to enable local protein synthesis at synapses
Slow transport: moves cytosol =>. Mostly passive
