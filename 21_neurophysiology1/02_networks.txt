Divergence: pattern where activating one neuron activates many other neurons. Common in input. Vs convergence, common in output
Feedforward inhibition: pattern where the active pathway inhibits opposing pathways
Feedback inhibition: pattern where the active pathway regulates itself
GRADED POTENTIAL: potential that is proportional in time and amplitude to the stimulus
    Input signals to neurons are graded potentials
    Translated to action potentials, constant in "shape"
    Input amplitude translated into action potential frequency
    Graded potentials are local, action potentials are for transmission
TRIGGER ZONE: axon initial segment
    Integrative function: highest density of Na+ channels => where the decision to generate action potentials is made
Active zone: where synaptic vesicles are excreted
