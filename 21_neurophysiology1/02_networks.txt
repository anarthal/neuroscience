Divergence: pattern where activating one neuron activates many other neurons. Common in input. Vs convergence, common in output
Feedforward inhibition: pattern where the active pathway inhibits opposing pathways
Feedback inhibition: pattern where the active pathway regulates itself
Lateral inhibition: pattern where excitatory cell in the main path excites cells that inhibit nearby cells
    E.g. edge enhancement in visual pathway
GRADED POTENTIAL: potential that is proportional in time and amplitude to the input that produced it
    RECEPTOR POTENTIAL: graded potential generated by a stimulus (e.g. touch)
    SYNAPTIC POTENTIAL: graded potential generated by a synapse
    Passive: they decrease with time and distance
    Graded potentials are local, action potentials are for transmission
    May generate action potentials, constant in "shape"
    Input amplitude translated into action potential frequency
TRIGGER ZONE: axon initial segment
    Integrative function: highest density of Na+ channels => where the decision to generate action potentials is made
Active zone: where synaptic vesicles are excreted
