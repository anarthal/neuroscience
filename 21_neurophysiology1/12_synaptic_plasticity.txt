TETANIC STIMULATION: high-frequency sequence of individual stimulations to a neuron
SYNAPTIC FACILITATION: short-term increase in the synaptic strength upon shortly-spaced action potentials
    Some Ca2+ remains in the post-synaptic element (from the previous AP) when the next AP arrives
    This causes more neurotransmitter to be released
    Lasts milliseconds
SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION: short-term decrease in the synaptic strength upon repeated shortly-spaced stimulation
    Because the pool of synaptic vesicles is depleted
    Lasts milliseconds
SYNAPTIC AUGMENTATION: similar to facilitation, but lasts seconds
    Due to Ca2+ accumulation
SYNAPTIC POTENTIATION/POST-TETANIC POTENTIATION: similar to facilitation, but lasts minutes
    Due to Ca2+ accumulation, but != mechanism than augmentation
