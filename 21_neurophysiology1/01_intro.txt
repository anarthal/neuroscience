action potential wave shape is always the same: same amplitude, length, ...
    information is conveyed by the pathway (what circuit it's happening in) and the frequency that potentials are fired upon
> dendritic complexity in human pyramidal cells => probably why we have greater capacity
> inhibitory regions in human brain than in animals
> non-neuronal cells in human brain than in animals
