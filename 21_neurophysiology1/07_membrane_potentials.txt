We can model excitable cells as electrical circuits
    Ion channels act as resistances
    Electromotive force for ions act as batteries
    Non-conductive part of the membrane acts as a capacitor
Ion concentrations
    K+ more abundant inside, Na+, Ca2+, Cl- more abundant outside
        In developing cells, Cl- more abundant inside
    NERNST EQUATION: electrical potential for a single ion species in equilibrium
        E_in = RT/zF * ln(C_out/C_in)
        Equilibrium happens when the electric field compensates the effect of diffusion because of the concentration gradient
        For cations, the bigger C_in, the more negative the potential
    GOLDMAN EQUATION: membrane electrical potential for several ion species in steady state
        Vm: membrane potential
        In steady state, since Vm != E_K, E_Na, E_Cl, there are currents inside/outside the cell
        E.g. K+: Vm < Ek => K+ ions exit the cell
        Na+/K+ pump, Cl- co-transporters maintain the gradients by neutralizing the leakage current
        Leakage currents depend on (E_xx - Vm) but also on the permeability (conductance)
        In resting conditions, K+ permeability is the biggest
        When depolarized, Na+ permeability is the biggest
