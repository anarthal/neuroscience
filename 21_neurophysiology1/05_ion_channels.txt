Channels produce current spikes to generate action potentials, vs. transporters/pumps that maintain concentration gradients
Cl- channels regulate excitability
Channel characteristics
    High-throughput, vs. ion transporters and pumps
    Move ions downhill their concentration gradient, vs. pumps
    Voltage-gated, ligand-gated, thermo/mechano-sensitive
    Selective: only one or a set of ions can pass
Channel states
    Resting: closed but can open
    Open
    Inactive/refractory: closed and can't open
For the same ion, != channel types with != kinetic properties
    E.g. some Na+ channels inactivate quickly, others don't and keep a small current during resting potential
Voltage-gated channels
    Structure
        Membrane-spanning regions
        Voltage-sensor domains
        Selective pore filter
    Na+, Ca2+, K+ channels fit this
    Cl- channels have a single amino-acid close to pore as voltage sensor, instead
    Selective for single ion
Ligand-gated channels
    Can admit more than one ion type
    Ionotropic vs. metabotropic
Ion transporter: moves some ions uphill and others downhill the concentration gradient. No ATP required
Measuring voltage/currents
    CONDUCTANCE: inverse of resistance
    VOLTAGE CLAMP: fix membrane potential by injecting the required current
        Measures injected current => cell conductance for a certain membrane potential
        Measures current for the entire cell
    PATCH CLAMP: refinement of voltage clamp to measure current of an individual ion channel
        Attaches a glass pipette to a patch of the cell membrane, spanning a single ion channel, fixes voltage and measures current
