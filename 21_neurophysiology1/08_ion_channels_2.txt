Many != types of ionic channels, in != neuron types and in != neuron zones
    Differences allow != responses to adapt to !=, complex stimuli
    Neurons specialize by expressing != types of ion channels (especially K+ channels)
    Neuron max firing rate depends on which types of ion channels the neuron has (faster channels => higher firing rate)
K+ channel types: the more varied ones
    Delayed rectifiers: slow dynamics, Hodgkin Huxley model. Open slowly but they don't inactivate
    Ca2+ activated channels: regulated by the amount of Ca2+ inside the cell (open when Ca2+ enters the cell). Depolarization also helps
    A-type channels: like Na+ channels: activate rapidly and inactivate
    M-type: slow dynamics, but activated by ACh
Cytoplasmic effects (e.g. Ca2+ or 2nd messengers) also change the dynamics of channels
Types of ion channels depend on the neuron region we're looking to
    Dendrites: have a lot of != channel types to respond to stimuli and perform the integration of these
        Backpropagation of action potentials: propagate AP to dendrites. Modulates inputs during AP
    Axon initial segment: high density of channels with low threshold requirements, to start generating AP: Na+, M-type K+, A-type K+
    Nodes of Ranvier
        In node: high density of Na+ channels
        Paranode: the site where myelin is anchored
        Juxta paranode: inside the sheet, next to paranode. High density of K+ channels, to produce hyperpolarization
    Presynaptic terminals: Ca2+, to trigger neurotransmitter release
Nodes of Ranvier problems
    The longer nodes of Ranvier are, the slower the conduction. More membrane exposed => more capacitance
    If myelin sheath doesn't seal completely (bad scaffold proteins), ion current flows inside paranode
        no separation between Na+ and K+ channels => depolarization and hyperpolarization at the same time => AP lost
Neuron specialization examples
    Auditory neurons can fire at high frequency because they have Kv3 K+ channels => fast repolarization
    Neurons with A-type K+ channels introduce a delay in their response to the input if they were hyperpolarized before
        Because hyperpolarization removes A-type K+ channel inactivation => Transient K+ current on depolarization => Delay
    Potential-dependent excitability: a neuron has Ca2+ channels
        In resting potential, Ca2+ are inactivated
        If the neuron is hyperpolarized and has Ca2+ channels, these are no longer inactivated
        A smaller input causes Ca2+ channels to open, in addition to Na+ channels => may cause an AP even at subthreshold inputs
    Accommodation: prevents repetitive firing upon a prolonged stimulus due to M-type K+ channels
        Happens in sympathetic system
        Prolonged stimulus opens M-type K channels => current that doesn't allow more than one action potential
        ACh closes M-type channels => accommodation doesn't happen
    HYPERPOLARIZATION-ACTIVATED CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE CHANNEL (HCN): generates a depolarizing current on hyperpolarization => pacemaking
        Hyperpolarization opens HCN => depolarization
        Low-threshold Ca2+ channels => open with minimal depolarization => more depolarization
        Na+ channels and action potential. Ca2+ and HCN close
        Repolarization starts the cycle again
