Ion concentrations
    K+ more abundant inside, Na+, Ca2+, Cl- more abundant outside
    In developing cells, Cl- more abundant inside
ELECTROCHEMICAL POTENTIAL for an ion: net driving force for an ion species to move across the membrane (volts). Sum of
    Concentration gradient: due to the uneven distribution of ion species across the membrane
    Electrical gradient: due to the electric field caused by the membrane accumulating opposite charges
EQUILIBRIUM POTENTIAL for an ion (E_ion): membrane potential where electrochemical potential is zero for that ion (electric force compensates concentration gradient)
    NERNST EQUATION: equilibrium potential for a single ion species
        E_in = RT/zF * ln(C_out/C_in)
    Equilibrium happens when the electric field compensates the effect of diffusion because of the concentration gradient
    For cations, the bigger C_out, the more positive the potential (e.g. Na)
GOLDMAN EQUATION: membrane resting potential (electrical potential for several ion species in steady state)
    Vm = RT/F * ln((P_Na * C_Na_out + P_K * C_K_out + P_Cl * C_Cl_in) / (P_Na * C_Na_in + P_K * C_K_in + P_Cl * C_Cl_out))
    P_ion: permeability of the ion species across the membrane. Has dimensions
    Vm tends to the E_ion for the ion with highest permeability
        In resting conditions, K+ permeability is the biggest
        When depolarized, Na+ permeability is the biggest
    In steady state, since Vm != E_K, E_Na, E_Cl, there are currents inside/outside the cell
        E.g. K+: Vm < Ek => K+ ions exit the cell
    Na+/K+ pump, Cl- co-transporters maintain the gradients by neutralizing the leakage current
    Leakage currents depend on (E_xx - Vm) but also on the permeability (conductance)
Usual values
    Vm = -65mV
    E_K = -79mV
    E_Na = 60mV
    E_Cl = -70mV
We can model excitable cells as electrical circuits
    Ion channels act as resistances
    Electromotive force for ions act as batteries
    Non-conductive part of the membrane acts as a capacitor
    Ion pumps act as current sources (and keep batteries charged)
