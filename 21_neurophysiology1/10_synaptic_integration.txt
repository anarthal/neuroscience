POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY: site in the postsynaptic element containing the neurotransmitter receptors (this is why it's electron dense in the microscope)
The receptor determines whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory, not the neurotransmitter
Morphological classification of synapses
    These are guidelines, the only definitive way to determine if excitatory/inhibitory is biochemical tests, but this is usually enough
    Type I/asymmetric
        Postsynaptic density is very big
        Usually excitatory
        Contact in dendritic spines
    Type II/symmetric
        Postsynaptic density similar to presynaptic
        Usually inhibitory
        Contact in dendritic tree or soma
REVERSAL POTENTIAL: for an ion channel, membrane potential where no net current flows
    For channels that conduct a single type of ion, equal to the equilibrium potential
    Makes sense for channels conducting more than one type of ion
Glutamate receptors
    Ionotropic: reversal potential == 0. Always excitatory
        AMPA: conduct Na+ and K+
        Kainate: like AMPA
        NMDA: conduct Na+, K+ and Ca2+
            Has a Mg2+ block that is removed with depolarization => coincidence detector
    Metabotropic: may be excitatory or inhibitory
    PSD-95: postsynaptic scaffold protein holding the receptors together, on the inside of the cell
        Used as a marker of a postsynaptic element. Antibodies used to identify it
GABA receptors: inhibitory
    GABAA: ionotropic. Open Cl- channels
    GABAB: metabotropic. End up opening K+ channels
Axon initial segment performs the summation because it's the zone with lower threshold (highest Na+ density)
Properties affecting integration
    Time constant τ: the bigger, the more likely that two EPSPs close in time are summed together
    Length constant λ: the bigger, the more likely that two EPSPs in != regions are summed together
DENDRITIC SPIKE: an AP generated in a dendrite. Propagated electrotonically to the cell body and axon initial segment  
Synapse location (axo-dendritic, somatic, axonic) determines its function. E.g. axo-axonic regulates neurotransmitter release
