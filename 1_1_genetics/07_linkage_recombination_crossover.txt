Background
    RECOMBINATION: process that makes progeny contain a combination of parental traits, != than individual parents combinations
    RECOMBINANT GAMETES: gametes produced by an individual that are != gametes of the individual's parents that generated the individual
Not all genes follow Mendel's independent assortment, as num chromosomes << num genes
    UNLINKED GENES: segregate independently (Mendel)
    LINKED GENES: tend to segregate together in meiosis, not following Mendel's 2nd law
    LINKAGE GROUP: a group of genes that tend to segregate together
    During meiosis, crossovers can break linked genes and generate recombinations
    Physical distance in the chromosome => More likely to get crossovers
Degree of linkage between two genes
    Complete linkage: they always segregate together. Same chromosome, close together
    Incomplete linkage: they sometimes segregate together, but sometimes crossover. Same chromosome, some distance
    Assort independently: never segregate together. != chromosomes or same chromosome but far away
    To evaluate it: testcross: heterozygous x homozygous
        If 1:1:1:1 (Mendel): assort independently
        If 1:1 (only the parental combinations shown): complete linkage
        In-between: incomplete linkage
RECOMBINATION FREQUENCY (RF): probability of obtaining recombinant gametes = num recombinant gametes / num total gametes
    (????) If crossover happens in meiosis, it affects only 2 non-sister chromatids
        max(RF) = 50%
        RF = Pr(crossover during meiosis) / 2
    RF = 50% => genes assort independently; RF < 50% => linkage
    Estimate RF with test cross: RF = num recombinant progeny / num total progeny
GENETIC MAP: line showing genes on a linkage group, with relative positions and distances in terms of RF
    Morgan: crossovers occur at random along chromosomes
    RF estimates physical distance between genes
    Centi-Morgan (cM): unit describing a RF between two genes of 1%
    Distances are approximately additive
    Accurate when distances are short. Long distances underestimated because of double crossovers
    Three-point testcross: cross heterozygous for 3 traits with homozygous recessive
        More efficient than several two-point testcrosses: less tests, detects double crossovers
        Non-recombinant: 2 more abundant phenotypes, double crossover: 2 less abundant phenotypes
        Gene in the middle: the one that, when double crossover happens, generates the less abundant phenotypes
        RF(gene A-B) = (num progeny single crossover A-B + num progeny double crossover) / num total progeny
    We expect crossover events to be independent, but they are not: one crossover inhibits subsequent ones
        Expected progeny double crossover = total * RF(A-B) * RF(B-C)
        COEFFICIENT OF COINCIDENCE: CC = num actual double crossovers / num expected double crossovers
        COEFFICIENT OF INTERFERENCE = 1 - CC
