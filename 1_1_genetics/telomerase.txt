Background
    TERT: Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase
    Metabolic cages: cage that allows accurate measurements of food intake, urine, feces
    Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS): generates intestine ulcers
    Tightrope test: measures muscular coordination, biomarker of age. Place mice in a bar and see how much they stand before falling
    Glucose intolerance: higher level of glucose in blood than usual (pre-diabetic). Biomarker of age
        Measured with the area under the curve for glucose: the less, the better
    Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF1): low exposure = slower aging, higher levels = better fitness, decreases with age
    gamma-H2AX: phosphorylated H2A histone, marker of DNA damage
    Telomeric Repeat Factor 1 (TRF1): protein part of the shelterin complex that protects telomeres
        Colocalization with gamma-H2AX indicates DNA damage due to telomeric shortening
    TERT may extend lifetime due to activities != telomeric repair
    Q-FISH: Quantitative Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization. Measures the amount of a particular DNA sequence
    CLONOGENIC ASSAY: study to measure the capability of a cell to divide and form a colony
    Phosphate-buffer saline (PBS): buffer solution
High-level
    Telomerase: better fitness, better aging, longer lifespan, but higher tumorigenesis
    Mechanism: replenishing telomeres
    With tumor suppressors, we can get the positive features without the tumorigenesis
Procedure
    Mice tumor suppressors: p53, p16, p19ARF
    TgTert: transgenic mice that express TERT constitutively in epithelial tissue cells
    Mice types
        TgTert: only TERT
        [*] Sp53: extra copy of p53 tumor suppressor gene
        Sp16/SArf: extra copy of p16 and Arf tumor suppressors
        [*] Sp53/TgTert: extra copy of p53 tumor suppressor gene and TERT constitutively expressed
        [*] Sp53/Sp16/Sarf: extra copy of all tumor suppressors
        [*] Sp53/Sp16/SArf/TgTert: have extra copies of tumor suppressors and TERT constitutively expressed
        Comparisons: Sp53/TgTert vs Sp53, Sp53/Sp16/Sarf/TgTert vs Sp53/Sp16/Sarf
    Measure fitness, aging biomarkers, lifespan and tumorigenesis of TgTert* mice vs. controls
Low-level
    Mice with single copy of suppressors have normal lifespan, but Sp53/Sp16/Sarf have longer lifespan and better aging
    TgTert* mice express telomerase as in other natural events that cause telomerase expression (e.g. T cell activation)
    Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/Sarf cancel tumorigenesis effects of Tert
    Effects visible only if Terc also expressed => Because of telomerase (test with Terc deficient mice)
    Tert may also have telomerase-independent effects
    Thickness of sub-cutaneous adipose layer: better in TgTert*
    Length of intestinal villi: better in TgTert*
    Blood in feces: measurement of intestine ulcers, better in TgTert*
    Old TgTert* mice perform better in tightrope test
    Old TgTert* mice have better glucose tolerance
    No food intake differences in TgTert* mice
    Old TgTert* mice have higher levels of IGF1 in serum
    Sp53/Sp16/Sarf show less gamma-H2AX. But only TgTert* have less colocalization with TRF1
    TgTert* mice have longer life span
    TgTert* mice without the Terc component don't have longer life span => Because of telomere lengthening
    TgTert* mice have longer telomeres (even young ones), in both stem and tissue cells
    TgTert* mice have epidermal stem cells with better clonogenic activity
    In general: TgTert* mice have better fitness (even young ones), age better and live longer
        This happens even in organs that don't express TERT => Systemic anti-aging
    Sp53 and Sp53/Sp16/Sarf show less telomere attrition: adult stem cells divide slower
