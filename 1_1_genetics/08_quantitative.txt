Background
    MERISTIC trait: integral (e.g. litter size)
Difficult to work with
    Polygenic: multiple genes involved
    Strong env influence => multifactorial
    Multiple genotypes yielding the same phenotype
Multiple gene hypothesis: inherited following Mendel, effects are additive
Determining number of loci, if all genes segregate independently, additive, equal effect, low env influence
    Cross pure-breeding, then intercross F1
    Frequency parental = (1/4)^n
    num phenotype classes = 2n + 1
Statistics
    var = s^2 = sum((mean - xi)^2) / (n - 1)
    std = s = sqrt(s)
    cov = sum((meanx - xi)(meany - yi)) / (n - 1)
    correlation coefficient = cov / (sx*sy)
HERITABILITY: proportion of a quantitative trait due to genetic factors (as opposed to env)
    Not fixed for a trait: depends on population and env
    Partition of variance: analyze how much of the variance is due to genetic factors
        Vp: (total) phenotypical variance
        Vg: genetic variance (part of Vp due to genetics)
        Ve: environmental variance (part of Vp due to env)
        Vge: genetic-environmental variance (some genotypes are more suitable for certain environments than others)
        Va: additive genetic variance (due to additive effects of alleles of parents, ignoring interactions)
        Vd: dominance genetic variance (deviation Va => Vg due to dominance)
        Vi: interaction genetic variance (like Vd, but for != loci)
        Vp = Vg + Ve + Vge
        Vg = Va + Vd + Vi
    BROAD-SENSE HERITABILITY H^2 = Vg / Vp between (0.0, 1.0)
        Most traits in the middle
    NARROW-SENSE HERITABILITY h^2 = Va / Vp between (0.0, 1.0)
        More useful for selective breeding: Va is what determines what is passed to offsprings
    Estimate H^2 by eliminating variance components
        Raise pure-breeding individuals (Vg = 0) in an environment => Ve
        Raise genetically varying individuals in the same environment => Vp
        Suppose Ve is the same for both => Vg = Vp - Ve
        Problems: pure-breeding and supposing Ve is the same
    Estimate h^2 with response to artificial selection
        RESPONSE TO SELECTION R = mean phenotype offsprings - mean phenotype of original population
        SELECTION DIFFERENTIAL S = mean phenotype of selected parents - mean phenotype of original population
        h^2 = R/S
        Artificial selection has a limit: after many generations, genetic variance exhausted, h^2 = 0
