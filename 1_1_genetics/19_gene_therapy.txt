Background
    TROPISM: the kind of cells a virus may infect
    GENOTOXICITY: ability of a substance to damage functional genes, causing mutations
    CHIMERIC GENE: one made of parts of other genes
GENE THERAPY: introduce nucleic acid sequences in the cell to correct a disease or alter characteristic
TRANSFECTION: process of deliberately introducing nucleic acids into a cell
VECTOR: vehicle used to introduce genetic material into a cell
MULTIPLICITY OF INFECTION (MOI): number of vector particles introduced per cell. MOI 3 = 3 particles/cell
Easier to treat monogenic diseases than cancer
Types
    EX-VIVO: cells are extracted, modified, and inserted back. More controlled, but can't be applied to every disease
    IN-VIVO: cells modified directly in the patient. More general, but less controlled.
    EPISOMAL/NON-INTEGRATIVE: provided DNA doesn't integrate into the target cell's chromosome => Transient effect
    INTEGRATIVE: provided DNA integrates into the target cell's chromosome => Permanent
    Addition: add material. May be episomal or integrative
    Edition: replace material. Always permanent. E.g. CRISPR-CAS9
Viral vectors: modified virus used as vectors
    High efficiency => The most common
    May generate immune response
    May generate replication-competent virus (RCVs): modified virus recombines back to wild-type, infectious one
    Limited DNA size
Engineering a viral vector
    Virus genome
        LTR: promoter, enhancer, start site and other non-coding sequences, required
        Encapsidation signal (psi): DNA containing this signal will get inside the capside
        Viral genes: toxic genes, capside protein genes, polymerases...
    Vector DNA: virus, but viral genes replaced by therapeutic genes
    Helper DNA: virus, but encapsidation signal has been removed
    Place both in a helper cell: vector DNA replicates and gets encapsidated, but viral genes do not => Target
    Retrovirus genome elements
        gag (capside proteins)
        pro (protease for maturation)
        pol (replication: integrase and reverse-transcriptase)
        env (proteins to attach to the host cell)
    Separate helper DNA into packaging plasmid (gag, pol) and envelope plasmid (env) => Avoid generating RCVs
    Retrovirae family
        Î³-retrovirus
            Integrative
            Only for replicating cells
            Tends to integrate close to transcription start sites => Genotoxicity
        Lentivirus (e.g. HIV)
            Integrative
            Both replicating and quiescent cells
            Integrates randomly
        Virus promoter/enhancer (LTR) are too powerful and may activate proximal genes (e.g. proto-oncogenes)
            Self-inactivating vector: delete promoter from 3' region and incorporate custom promoter
        Did the viral vector integrate correctly? (integration profile, ex-vivo)
            Pick a cell, clone it, analyze some. Introduce the ones that had the desired modification
    Adenovirus
        Non-integrative
        Both replicating and quiescent cells
        May generate immune response, although has been made better with time
        Allow big DNA segments
    Adenovirus-associated vectors (AAV)
        Non-integrative (wild-type virus is integrative, but vector is not)
        Both replicating and quiescent cells
        Low immune response
        Allow small DNA segments only
Cell differentiation
    Totipotent cell: may yield any other cell type + placenta
    Pluripotent cell: may yield any other body cell type
    Multipotent cell: adult stem cells, yields a subset of body cell types
    Differentiated cell: performs a single function, usually it does not divide
