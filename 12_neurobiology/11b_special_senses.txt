sensation: physically receiving the signal from our senses
perception: interpreting the signal
olfactory
    olfactory epithelium: where the receptors are (nasal cavity)
    olfactory sensory neurons: bipolar. The receptors
        has cilia where the receptors are located
    supporting cells: mechanical support for olfactory neurons
    basal cells: stem cells that can generate new neurons
