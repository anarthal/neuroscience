Background
    AVASCULAR: not reached by blood vessels
    ENDOTHELIUM: blood vessel internal wall
    LUMEN: the inside space of a vessel or cavity
    FIBRIL: thread-like structure, small scale. Vs. fibers, which are bigger
    CELL-ADHESION MOLECULE (CAM): protein that promotes adhesion between cells
EPITHELIUM: avascular tissue covering surfaces, cavities and forming glands
    Cells close to each other, bound by specific cell junctions
    Cells exhibit polarity, forming three domains: apical, lateral, basal
    Cells attached to basement membrane in their basal domain
Classification
    Simple: single layer of cells
        Simple squamous: planar cells. E.g. endothelium
        Simple cuboidal: cubic cells. E.g. kidney tubules
        Simple columnar: long cells. E.g. small intestine
        Pseudostratified: all cells attached to basement membrane, but not all to apical domain. E.g. trachea
    Stratified: multiple layers of cells
        Stratified squamous: planar cells. E.g. epidermis
        Stratified cuboidal: cubic cells
        Stratified columnar: long cells
        Transitional: cell type changes with layer. E.g. urethra
APICAL DOMAIN: region that faces the lumen or exterior. In contact with env. Modifications:
    MICROVILLI: membrane protrusions formed by actin filaments. Passive movement. Increase absorption surface (e.g. intestine)
    STEREOCILIA: similar structure, much longer. Passive movement. Absorptive or sensitive (e.g. inner ear). Less frequent
    CILIA: membrane protrusions formed by microtubules
        Primary: non-motile. Sensory functions. Lots of cells have them. 9+0 structure
        Motile: active upward-downward movement. 9+2 structure. Many per cell and short (e.g. respiratory, to clean up mucus). Except flagella (sperm)
        Nodal: active rotational movement. 9+0 structure. In embryo
LATERAL DOMAIN: region in contact with neighboring epithelial cells
    Junctions composed of cell-adhesion molecules
    All junction types present in each cell
    OCCLUDING JUNCTION/ZONULA OCCLUDENS/TIGHT JUNCTION: tight, closed junction
        Close to the apical domain
        No transport
        Formed by occludin and claudin proteins
    ANCHORING JUNCTION: perform cell-to-cell adhesion. More basal than occluding ones
        ZONULA ADHERENS: links cytoskeletal actin filaments of two cells together
            CADHERIN: calcium-dependent protein performing the link between membranes
            NECTIN: like cadherins, but calcium-independent
        MACULA ADHERENS/DESMOSOME: links cytoskeletal intermediate filaments of two cells together
            Uses desmocollin and desmoglein as connective proteins
    COMMUNICATING JUNCTION: allows direct transport of substances between cells
        CONNEXON: tube-like structure communicating two cells
        CONNEXIN: protein that forms connexons
        Connexons can be open and closed, and their state can change over time
        In cells that require tight communication, e.g. cardiac muscle
BASAL DOMAIN: region that faces connective tissue
    BASEMENT MEMBRANE: structure between basal domain of epithelial cells and connective tissue
        Attachment site. Scaffolding for tissue regeneration
        Filters substances. Involved in cell signalling
        Made of extracellular proteins (no cells)
        BASAL LAMINA: 1st layer, dense, where the epithelial cells attach
            Laminin layer
            Type IV collagen
        RETICULAR LAMINA: 2nd layer, made of fibrils
            Not always present in-vivo. Almost always lost in preparations
            Reticular fibrils, type VII collagen (anchors), fribrilin (anchors)
    Cell-to-extracellular matrix junctions: because epithelial cells require support from connective tissue
        Junctions cross the membrane, until the connective tissue
        FOCAL ADHESIONS: junctures that use actin filaments. More dynamic
        HEMIDESMOSOMES: junctures that use intermediate filaments. More static
    Basement membrane infolding: membrane is irregular (not planar)
        Increases surface => Better interaction between cells and with ECM
GLAND: epithelial tissue whose main function is to secrete substances, either to lumen or to connective tissue
    EXOCRINE GLAND: secretes its products to the lumen
        MEROCRINE GLAND: substance in vesicles (exocytosis). E.g. pancreas
        APOCRINE GLAND: substance surrounded by cell membrane/cytoplasm. E.g. mammary glands
        HOLOCRINE GLAND: substance secreted by apoptosis when concentration is high. E.g. sebaceous glands
            Usually in stratified tissue => When one cell dies, the next one comes in
    ENDOCRINE GLAND: secretes its products into the underlying connective tissue => blood stream
    For both the above glands and using the above mechanisms
        PARACRINE SIGNALLING: secreted molecules target close epithelial/connective tissue cells
        AUTOCRINE SIGNALLING: secreted molecules target the cell itself
            Self-regulation mechanism: stop secreting when there's enough product
