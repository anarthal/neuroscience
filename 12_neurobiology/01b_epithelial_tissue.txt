Background
    AVASCULAR: not reached by blood irrigation
    ENDOTHELIUM: blood vessel internal wall
    LUMEN: the inside space of a vessel or cavity
EPITHELIUM: avascular tissue covering surfaces, cavities and forming glands
    Cells close to each other, bound by specific cell junctions
    Cells exhibit polarity, forming three domains: apical, lateral, basal
    Cells attached to basement membrane in their basal domain
Classification
    Simple: single layer of cells
        Simple squamous: planar cells. E.g. endothelium
        Simple cuboidal: cubic cells. E.g. kidney tubules
        Simple columnar: long cells. E.g. small intestine
        Pseudostratified: all cells attached to basement membrane, but not all to apical domain. E.g. trachea
    Stratified: multiple layers of cells
        Stratified squamous: planar cells. E.g. epidermis
        Stratified cuboidal: cubic cells
        Stratified columnar: long cells
        Transitional: cell type changes with layer. E.g. urethra
APICAL DOMAIN: region that faces the lumen or exterior. In contact with env
