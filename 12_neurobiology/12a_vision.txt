iris: the one with the color
pupil: hollow part where the light enters
crystaline: converging lens
3 layers covering the eye, from the outer
    sclera: white of the eye
    choroid: red layer with a lot of blood vessels
    retina: nerve tissue where the image is formed
cornea: transparent layer anterior to the crystaline
limbus: part between cornea and sclera
extrinsic eye muscles: responsible for eye movements
fibrous tunica: cornea and sclera
vascular tunica: choroid and 
anterior chamber: between cornea and lens, filled with aqueous humor
posterior chamber: between lens and retina, filled with vitreous humor
retina
    neural retina: nervous tissue. From inner to outer
        photoreceptors: not neurons, just sensory receptors
        bipolar layer: neurons that transmit
        ganglion layer: the following neurons
    pigmented retina: epithelial tissue, anterior to neural retina
        black, full of melanin
        renews photoreceptors
        catches light that is not absorbed by the photoreceptors
        why we see pupil as black
photoreceptors
    rod: for night vision (black and white)
    cones: for color vision. RBG cones: each one is sensitive to a certain wavelength
photopigments
    opsin: GPCR protein. != type of opsin depending on the photoreceptor type
    retinal: small molecule that changes conformation (cis-retinal, trans-retinal)
transduction
    by default, neurons are depolarized and emitting glutamate (in the dark)
        cGMP concentration is cytosol is high
        Na+ channels are open
        Ca2+ channels are open => synapse
        in this context, glutamate is inhibitory: the bipolar cell is active only when glutamate is inactive
    when there is light
        cis becomes trans
        this activates GPCR
        cGMP becomes regular GMP
after ganglion neurons, thalamus, primary vision area, visual association cortex
