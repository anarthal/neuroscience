EXTRINSIC EYE MUSCLES: muscles that move the eye
Eyeball anatomy
    FIBROUS TUNICA: outer, protective layer of the eyeball
        SCLERA: outer, white cover of dense connective tissue
        CORNEA: transparent layer that covers the lens. Continuous with sclera
        LIMBUS: transition zone between cornea and sclera
    VASCULAR TUNICA: intermediate layer of the eyeball
        CHOROID: vascular layer beneath sclera that provides nutrients
        PUPIL: hollow part anterior to lens that lets light in. Adjustable in size
        IRIS: extension of choroid that adjusts pupil's size. Responsible for eye color
    RETINA: inner layer of the eyeball, where images are formed
        PIGMENTED RETINA: melanin-rich, inner layer of retina
            Absorbs excess light
            Renews photoreceptors
            Why we see the pupil black
        NEURAL RETINA: signal transduction
            Photoreceptor layer: contains cells that absorb light
            Bipolar layer: 1st order neurons
            Ganglion layer: 2nd order neurons
    Lens: converging, to focus images in the retina
    ANTERIOR CHAMBER: between cornea and lens, filled with aqueous humor
    VITREOUS CHAMBER: between lens and retina, filled with vitreous humor
Photoreceptors
    Rods: for night vision (black and white). More sensitive than cones
    Cones: for color vision. Each one sensitive to red, blue or green
Transduction
    Photopigments
        Opsin: GPCR protein. != type of opsin depending on the photoreceptor type
        Retinal: small molecule that changes conformation (cis-retinal, trans-retinal)
    Dark response: when there is no light
        cGMP concentration is cytosol is high
        Na+ channels are open
        Ca2+ channels are open => synaptic vesicles released (glutamate, inhibitory)
        Bipolar neurons are not activated
    Light response
        Isomerization: cis becomes trans
        GPCR activates => cGMP removed => Na+ channels close => Ca2+ channels close => no synaptic vesicles released
        Bipolar neurons activated
Pathway to the brain
    1st order: bipolar and ganglionic
    2nd order: thalamus
    Primary visual cortex
