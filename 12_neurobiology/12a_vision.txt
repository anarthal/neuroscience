EXTRINSIC EYE MUSCLES: muscles that move the eye
INTRINSIC EYE MUSCLES: muscles embedded in the eye (sphincter, dilator, ciliary)
Eyeball anatomy: moved to 21_neuroanatomy/09_vision.txt
Photoreceptors
    Rods: for night vision (black and white). More sensitive than cones
    Cones: for color vision. Each one sensitive to red, blue or green
Transduction
    Photopigments
        Opsin: GPCR protein. != type of opsin depending on the photoreceptor type
        Retinal: small molecule that changes conformation (cis-retinal, trans-retinal)
    Dark response: when there is no light
        cGMP concentration is cytosol is high
        Na+ channels are open
        Ca2+ channels are open => synaptic vesicles released (glutamate, inhibitory)
        Bipolar neurons are not activated
    Light response
        Isomerization: cis becomes trans
        GPCR activates => cGMP removed => Na+ channels close => Ca2+ channels close => no synaptic vesicles released
        Bipolar neurons activated
Pathway to the brain
    1st order: bipolar and ganglionic
    2nd order: thalamus
    Primary visual cortex
