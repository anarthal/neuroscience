Background
    Upper motor neuron: in cerebral cortex, synapses with spinal cord
    Lower motor neuron: in spinal cord, synapses with effectors
Physiopathology
    Motor neurons (both) degenerate and die => Fatal paralysis
    Immune system imbalance (inflammation in CNS) => Activated microglia, infiltration of T cells, changes in the level of CD4 and CD8...
    Oxidative stress (damages cells), e.g. by mutation of SOD1 (anti-oxidant)
    ER stress (misfolded proteins)
    Loss of autophagy capabilities (due to mutations)
    Downregulation of glutamate transporter in astrocytes => Excitotoxicity
