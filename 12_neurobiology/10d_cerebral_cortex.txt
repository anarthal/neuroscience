CEREBRAL CORTEX: outer part of the cerebrum, where gray matter is located
GYRUS: ridge on the surface of the brain, surrounded by sulci
SULCUS: groove entering the brain, separating gyri
Fissure: like a sulcus, but deeper
Lobes
    Frontal lobe: motor and behavior
    Parietal lobe: posterior to frontal. Somatosensory
    Occipital lobe: the most posterior. Vision
    Temporal lobe: the most lateral. Olfaction and hearing
    Insula lobe: below temporal lobe, adjacent to putamen. Part of the limbic system
    Longitudinal fissure: separates left and right hemispheres
    Lateral fissure: separates frontal/parietal and temporal lobes
    Central sulcus: separates frontal and parietal lobes
    Parieto-occipital sulcus: separates parietal and occipital lobes
Tracts
    ASSOCIATION TRACT: axons connecting gyri in the same hemisphere
    COMMISSURAL TRACT/COMMISSURE: axons connecting cerebral hemispheres (no vertical component, as in the decussation)
        CORPUS CALLOSUM: band of white matter connecting both hemispheres. Above lateral ventricles
        ANTERIOR COMMISSURE: tract that connects left and right temporal lobes. Anterior to thalamus
        POSTERIOR COMMISSURE: posterior to thalamus
    PROJECTION TRACT: axon connecting cerebral cortex and lower parts of the CNS
Functional areas
    Motor areas
        PRIMARY MOTOR AREA: generates output signals to initiate motor movement. In frontal lobe
        PREMOTOR AREA: initiation and retention of complex motor movement (vs. primary motor area). In frontal lobe
        BROCA'S AREA: speech production
    PRIMARY SENSORY AREA: area that receives direct input from senses
        Primary somatosensory area: parietal lobe
        Primary visual area: occipital lobe
        Primary auditory area: temporal lobe
    ASSOCIATION AREA: integrative function
        PRIMARY ASSOCIATION AREA/UNIMODAL ASSOCIATION AREA: integrates information from only one sense
        SECONDARY ASSOCIATION AREA/HETEROMODAL ASSOCIATION AREA: integrates information from multiple senses
        WERNICKE'S AREA: language comprehension
        PREFRONTAL CORTEX: reasoning, control of behavior
    LIMBIC SYSTEM: emotions and memory formation
Histology
    Gray matter in each area has at most 6 layers
        I.   Molecular layer: axons
        II.  External granular layer: small cells
        III. External pyramidal layer: small/medium pyramidal cells
        IV.  Internal granular layer: small cells
        V.   Internal pyramidal layer: large pyramidal cells
        VI.  Multiform layer: cells of all sizes. Connects with thalamus
    Depending on how many layers are present and how big each one is, areas can be classified
        ALLOCORTEX: low complexity. Lacks IV, V, VI
        MESOCORTEX: medium complexity
            AGRANULAR: lacks IV
            DYSGRANULAR: IV is very small
        ISOCORTEX: high complexity. All layers present
            EULAMINATE: depending on how much layer IV, eulaminate I, II and III
            KONIOCORTEX: the most complex
HOMUNCLE: mapping from body sensors/effectors and the cerebral cortex
    Not all areas are equally represented
Left hemisphere is logical, right hemisphere is more emotional/creative
