Background
    SYNOVIAL JOINT: joint between bones
CARTILAGE: specialized connective tissue with a mechanically resistant ECM
Avascular. Survives because the ECM allows diffusion from blood vessels, and metabolism is low
PERICHONDRIUM: dense irregular connective tissue surrounding some types of cartilage
Types: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, fibrocartilage
HYALINE CARTILAGE: homogeneous, semi-transparent. The most common
    Located in
        Articular surfaces (cushioning, low-friction surface)
        Walls of respiratory passages (structural support)
        Ventral ends of ribs, joining the sternum (cushioning)
        Epiphyseal plates (where bone grows)
        Fetal skeleton
    ECM
        Fibers: type II collagen
        Hyaluronan + proteoglycan aggregates (aggrecan): holds a lot of water
        Multiadhesive glycoproteins
    Cell population
        CHONDROCYTE: mature cells. Synthesize the ECM
        CHONDROBLAST: mesenchymal cell in the perichondrium and growing cartilage that might differentiate into a chondrocyte
        LACUNAE: spaces in the ECM where chondrocytes reside
        ISOGENOUS GROUP: cluster of chondrocytes recently generated by mitotic division
    Matrix surrounding isogenous groups does not stain homogeneously
        CAPSULAR MATRIX: ECM surrounding individual chondrocytes
            Type VI collagen, high concentration of ground substance molecules
        TERRITORIAL MATRIX: ECM surrounding the group. Lighter than capsular matrix
            Type II collagen, smaller concentration of ground substance molecules
        INTERTERRITORIAL MATRIX: the rest of the ECM
    Has perichondrium, except for epiphyseal plates and articular cartilage
    Difficult repair (avascular), only by differentiation of chondroblasts
    CALCIFICATION: deposition of phosphate crystals in the ECM. Happens with aging
ELASTIC CARTILAGE: like hyaline cartilage, but ECM contains elastic fibers
    Located in epiglottis, auricle of ear
    More flexible
    Does not calcify with age
    Has perichondrium
FIBROCARTILAGE: intermediate between dense connective tissue and hyaline cartilage
    Located in
        Intervertebral discs
        Insertions on tendons
        Pubic symphysis
    Function: resist deformation under stress
    Cell population
        Chondrocytes in isogenous groups, axially aligned
        Fibroblasts: smaller than chondrocytes, elongated nuclei
    ECM: like hyaline cartilage, but also contains type I collagen
    No perichondrium
CHONDROGENESIS: development process of cartilage
    Mesenchymal cells => chondroblasts => chondrocytes
    SOX-9: transcription factor that triggers differentiation
    CHONDROGENIC NODULE: aggregation of mesenchymal cells that will differentiate into cartilage
Growth
    APPOSITIONAL GROWTH: at the surface of existing cartilage. Differentiation of cells in the perichondrium
    INTERSTITIAL GROWTH: within existing cartilage. By mitotic division of chondrocytes
ENDOCHONDRAL OSSIFICATION: process of transformation of cartilage into bone during development
    Bones start as cartilage models that get replaced by bone
    Epiphyseal plate and articular cartilage remain cartilage
