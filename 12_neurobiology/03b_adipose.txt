Vascular tissue
WHITE ADIPOSE TISSUE: formed by single-droplet adipocytes
    Subcutaneous fascia: layer below the skin for thermal insulation
    Abdomen, buttocks, bone marrow, mammary gland...: energy storage and hormone production
    Below hand palms and feet: cushioning
    White adipocytes
        Very big (~x15 sizeof RBC)
        Filled by lipid droplet: thin cytoplasm, peripheral nucleus
    ADIPOKINE: substances secreted by adipocytes (hormones, growth factors). E.g. leptin
    Brain-gut-adipose axis: the 3 systems are inter-connected and regulate appetite, food intake and adipose tissue
        Short-term regulators
            Grehlin: increases appetite
            Peptide YY: suppresses appetite
        Long-term regulators
            Insulin: increases appetite
            Leptin: decreases appetite
    Differentiation: from mesenchymal cells
        LIPOBLAST: adipocyte in development
BROWN ADIPOSE TISSUE: formed by multi-droplet adipocytes
    Present in newborns, but disappears as they grow. In few places in adults (e.g. kidney)
    Thermogenesis: production of heat in brown adipocyte metabolism
        THERMOGENIN: mitochondrial protein that causes metabolism to produce heat instead of ATP
    Brown adipocytes are smaller than white ones
    Tissue crossed by bands of connective tissue (septa)
    Differentiation: from mesenchymal cells
    Trans-differentiation: brown <=> white to adapt to temperatures
