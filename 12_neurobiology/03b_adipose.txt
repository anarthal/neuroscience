white (unilocular): single droplet
secrete adipokines: substances secreted by adipocytes
    leptin: saciety factor
short term
    grehlin: increases appetite
    PYY: suppresses appetite
long term
    leptin: suppresses appetite
    insulin: 
brown adipose: in many places in newborn, fewer places in adult (e.g. kidney)
    no unique big lipid droplet as in the white one - just a mesh
    we can find fibers of connective tissue
    we can also find fibroblasts
    difficult to see individual cells
    thermogenesis: produces heat via a protein (thermogenin)
    they can transdifferentiate to white adipocytes, depending on temperature
lymphatic: fluid connective tissue
    ECM is a liquid (lymph)
    formed elements: cell population
        lymphocytes
            T-cells: have T-cell receptors. Classified according to surface markers they express (cluster of differentiation)
            B-cells: synthesize antibodies
            Natural-killer lymphocytes
        supporting cells: blood cells
    organization
        lymphatic vessels: tubules conducting lymph
        diffuse lymphatic tissue: accumulation of lymphocytes, with no encapsulation. Mostly T lymphocytes
        lymph nodes: encapsulated. Mostly B. Temporary. Two areas: 
            germinal center: B lymphocytes that have recognized an antigen, in the center
            corona: B lymphocytes that are naive
        lymphatic organs
