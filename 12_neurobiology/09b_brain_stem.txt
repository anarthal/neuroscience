medulla oblongata
    decussation of the pyramids: all nerves cross from left to right
        pyramids are in the ventral part
    some of them do not perform this cross
    has nuclei for autonomic functions like cardiac
        nuclei: groups of neuron soma
    has relay stations for sensors (names not reqd)
    last cranial nerves (nerves that don't go though spinal cord) exit there
pons
    respiratory center
    locus coeruleus: main center that produces noradrenaline, transported through the axons and released in synapse
    is the exit of other cranial nerves
midbrain
    colliculus not relevant
    substantia nigra: dopamine neurons
    red nucleus: pigmented with Fe, involved in motor movements. More relevant in other animals (we have the motor cortex)
    has also cranial nerves
    reticular formation: network of neurons
raphe nuclei: produces serotonin, connected to the rest of cerebral cortex
cranial nerves: emerge from brain and brain stem
    12 pairs (one for left, one for right) in total
    olfactory nerve: 
    optic nerve: vision (only sensory)
    vagus nerve: sensory (ear, larynx, internal...) and motor (speech, heart, lungs)
