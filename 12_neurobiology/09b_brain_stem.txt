Background
    CONTRALATERAL ORGANIZATION: brain hemispheres in one side control the other side of the body
    AROUSAL: process of wakening from sleep
MEDULLA OBLONGATA: inferior part of the brain stem. Ascending/descending tracts and nuclei
    Nuclei for vital functions (respiratory center, cardiovascular center, deglutition center)
    PYRAMIDS (medulla oblongata): tracts to/from the brain. Anterior
    DECUSSATION OF THE PYRAMIDS: crossing of tracts at the level of pyramids (contralateral control)
    MEDIAL LEMNISCUS: connects gracile/cuneate nuclei with thalamus
    GRACILE NUCLEUS: somatosensory info. Dorsal
    CUNEATE NUCLEUS: same as gracile nucleus, but for other body parts. Dorsal
    5 cranial nerves enter here (e.g. vagus, vestibulocochlear)
PONS: middle part of the brain stem. Same height as cerebellum
    Nuclei for vital functions (pons respiratory center)
    LOCUS COERULEUS: main noradrenaline production center. Dorsal (next to 4th ventricle)
    4 cranial nerves enter here
MIDBRAIN/MESENCEPHALON: upper part of the brain stem, just below diencephalon
    CEREBRAL PEDUNCLES/CRUS CEREBRI: tracts connecting cerebral cortex with brain stem. Anterior
        Corticospinal, corticobulbar, corticopontine motor tracts pass through here
    SUBSTANTIA NIGRA: dopaminergic neurons. Posterior to peduncles
        Connect with basal ganglia for movement control
        Part of reward circuit
    RED NUCLEUS: neurons pigmented with iron, involved in motor movements. Medial
    Cerebral aqueduct passes through here. Posterior to red nucleus
    COLLICULUS: each of the four rounded elevations in the posterior part of the midbrain
    4 cranial nerves enter here
RETICULAR FORMATION: network of neurons and axons dispersed through the brain stem
    Ascending: involved in awakening, maintenance of attention
    Descending: muscle tone and vital functions
    RAPHE NUCLEI: neurons producing serotonin in the reticular formation. Alterations connected to depression
CRANIAL NERVE: nerves emerging from brain stem and brain, rather than spinal cord
    12 in total, numbered from I (superior) to XII (inferior)
    Sensory cranial nerves: sensory info only (olfactory, optic, vestibulocochlear)
    Mixed cranial nerves: sensory and motor info (vagus)
