Post-mitotic
    Some adult stem cells can differentiate into new neurons
NEUROFILAMENTS: specialized intermediate filaments in neurons
Soma: cell body
    Euchromatic nucleus
    Rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, mitochondria => High anabolic activity
    NISSL BODIES: aggregations of RER and ribosomes
    AXON HILLOCK: conical extension of soma that connects with the beginning of the axon. Contains the MTOC
DENDRITE: prolongation of neuronal soma, with receptive functions
    DENDRITIC TREE: all the branches of a dendrite
    Wider diameter than axon
    Non-myelinated
    Passive, decremental signal conduction: signal decreases as we approach the soma
    Not all microtubules polarized in the same direction. Most have + in dendrite's end
    DENDRITIC SPINE: protrusions of plasma membrane in the dendrites
        Where synapses take place
        Dynamic: assemble and degrade fast (part of the plasticity process)
AXON/NERVE FIBER: single, long process that transmits impulses away from the neuron
    May be myelinated
    Cytoplasm contains cytoskeleton, mitochondria, vesicles
    All microtubules polarized in the same direction: + is in the axon's end
    AXON INITIAL SEGMENT: where the action potential is initiated
Structural classification
    MULTIPOLAR NEURON: one axon, >1 dendrites (the usual)
    BIPOLAR NEURON: one axon, 1 long dendrite (receptors for special senses)
    PSEUDOUNIPOLAR NEURON: one axon with two terminals, for PNS and CNS (sensory neurons close to CNS)
Functional classification
    SENSORY NEURON: from sensory receptors to CNS
    MOTOR NEURON: from CNS to effectors
        Somatic: targets skeletal muscle
        Visceral: targets smooth muscle or glands
    INTERNEURON: CNS to CNS (integrative network). The most common
Neuronal transport: vesicles, organelles, proteins
    Axonal
        Anterograde: away from the cell's body. Kinesin
        Retrograde: towards the cell's body. Dynein
    Dendritic: away from the cell's body. Dynein
