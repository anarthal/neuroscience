mechanistic theory of brain function: each of abilities (e.g. to move, breathe, think) is associated to one brain region
Law of Dynamic Polarization
    Dendrites and cell body: reception
    Axon: conduction
    Ramifications: application
Connectionism: basic functions work involving a single region, complex ones require distributed processing
Somatotopy: each body part is mapped to a certain region within the motor cortex
Cytoarchitecture: how are neurons organized?
Brodman areas: 52 areas classified according to cytoarchitecture
