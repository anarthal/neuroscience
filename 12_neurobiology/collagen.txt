Structure
    Long amino-acid helix, with a pattern repeated every 3 amino-acids
    Molecule: 3 helices bound together (triple helix). Helices may have the same or different patterns
    Fibril: several molecules bound together
    Fiber: several fibrils bound together
According to the structures they create
    Fibrillar: forms long fibers
    Non-fibrillar: it does not
        Fibril-Associated Collagen with Interrupted Triple helix (FACIT): support fibrillar collagens
Type I: the most abundant. Forms fibrils
    ECM fibers in connective tissue proper
Type II: cartilage. Forms fibrils
Type III: reticular fibers. Forms fibrils. Requires special staining
    Reticular lamina
    ECM in connective tissue, specially in lymphatic tissue
Type IV: basal lamina. Forms a lamina, rather than fibrils
Type VII: fibrils that anchor the basal lamina to the reticular lamina
