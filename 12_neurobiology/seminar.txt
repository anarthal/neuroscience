cortical formation: neurons in layers parallel to the brain's surface
vs. nuclear formation: in groups
vs. reticular: as a meshwork
the distribution is not homogeneous
how do we subdivide the cerebral cortex?
Golgi stains only 1% of the cells, but completely
lower mammals have less layers
cerebral cortex gets more complex with biological complexity
myelin stains generate myelo-architecture maps
cortex areas have clinical origin: initial areas defined by correlating symptoms in the patients and damaged areas in the brain
    the definition of areas is not done by cytoarchitecture
Brodmann: no, all brains have 6 layers. But some layers might be lost during development
cortical type
    homogenetic: always had 6 layers
        homotypical: have 6 layers, always
        heterotypical: had 6 layers but lost some of them
    heterogenetic: never had 6 layers
isocortex: always had 6 layers. vs. allocortex: the opposite
gradient of laminar complexity: number of layers increase progressively as we move
the gradient is not only cytological, also by flow of information
