BASAL GANGLIA/BASAL NUCLEI: set of nuclei below cerebral cortex. Part of the cerebrum
Anatomy: all structures symmetrical (have left and right components)
    GLOBUS PALLIDUS: lentiform, lateral to the thalamus
    PUTAMEN: also lentiform, more lateral than globus pallidus, and adjacent to it
    CAUDATE NUCLEUS: shape ~ lateral ventricle. Just below ventricle, above thalamus, more central than the other nuclei
    LENTIFORM NUCLEUS: globus pallidus + putamen
    STRIATUM: putamen + caudate nucleus
SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS: not part of basal ganglia, but associated to it
    On top of substantia nigra
    Neurotransmitter: glutamate (excitatory)
    Output: globus pallidus
MEDIUM SPINY NEURON: neurons in caudate nucleus and putamen (striatum)
    Neurotransmitter: GABA (inhibitory)
    Input: motor cortex and substantia nigra
    Output: thalamus (and then cerebral cortex)
Functions: motor control, learning and response to emotions. Also cognitive functions
Pathways
    Facilitating pathway: reverberating circuit with cerebral cortex, via basal ganglia and thalamus, that triggers movement
        Thalamus has excitatory connections to motor cortex
        Globus pallidus internal has inhibitory connections to thalamus => Inhibit unwanted movements
        Striatum has inhibitory connections to globus pallidus internal, but they don't fire by default
        Before a movement is performed, cerebral cortex activates striatum => inhibits globus pallidus => activates thalamus => activates motor cortex
    Indirect pathway: reverberating circuit with cerebral cortex, via basal ganglia, subthalamic nucleus and thalamus, that suppresses movement
        Subthalamic nucleus has excitatory connections to globus pallidus internal
        Cerebral cortex activates subthalamic nucleus => activates globus pallidus => inhibits thalamus
    Nigrostriatal pathway: substantia nigra to motor cortex, through basal ganglia, subthalamic nucleus and thalamus, that facilitates direct pathway
        Striatum has inhibitory connections to globus pallidus external, enabled by default
        Globus pallidus external has inhibitory connections to subthalamic nucleus, disabled by default
        Substantia nigra inhibits striatum => activate globus pallidus external => inhibit subthalamic nucleus => facilitate movement
PARKINSON: degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
    LEWY BODIES: alpha-synuclein aggregates in neurons that cause them to die
    Affects basal ganglia circuits
HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE: degeneration of spiny neurons in the striatum
    Breaks the indirect pathway => non-coordinated movements
