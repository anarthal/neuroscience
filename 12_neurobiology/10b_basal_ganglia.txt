not really ganglia because it's the CNS, should be basal nuclei
part of cerebrum
reverberating circuit with cerebral cortex, via thalamus
execution of voluntary movements and suppression of involuntary ones
    e.g. Parkinson has it affected
motor learning
motor responses for emotions (connected to amygdala)
note: substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus are not part
    (although they make a lot of connections)
globus pallidus
putamen
caudate nucleus
lentiform nucleus: globus pallidus + putamen
striatum: putamen + caudate nucleus
substantia nigra modulates activity of these neurons
subthalamic nucleus to the globus pallidus
medium spiny neurons
    the most numerous
    go to cerebral cortex via thalamus
thalamus usually inhibited via GABA, to initiate movement we need to remove GABA, made by *this, caused by substantia nigra
parkinson: substantia nigra neurons accumulate alpha synuclein => die
Huntington: degeneration of basal ganglia neurons => can't select the movement to execute


// TODO: make this pass through the thalamus
