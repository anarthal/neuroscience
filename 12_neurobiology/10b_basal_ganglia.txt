BASAL GANGLIA/BASAL NUCLEI: set of nuclei below cerebral cortex. Part of the cerebrum
Anatomy: all structures symmetrical (have left and right components)
    GLOBUS PALLIDUS: lentiform, lateral to the thalamus
    PUTAMEN: also lentiform, more lateral than globus pallidus, and adjacent to it
    CAUDATE NUCLEUS: shape ~ lateral ventricle. Just below ventricle, above thalamus, more central than the other nuclei
    LENTIFORM NUCLEUS: globus pallidus + putamen
    NEOSTRIATUM: putamen + caudate nucleus
SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS: not part of basal ganglia, but associated to it
    On top of substantia nigra
    Neurotransmitter: glutamate (excitatory)
    Output: globus pallidus
MEDIUM SPINY NEURON: neurons in caudate nucleus and putamen (striatum)
    Neurotransmitter: GABA (inhibitory)
    Input: motor cortex and substantia nigra
    Output: thalamus (and then cerebral cortex)
Functions: motor control, learning and response to emotions. Also cognitive functions
PARKINSON: degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
    LEWY BODIES: alpha-synuclein aggregates in neurons that cause them to die
    Affects basal ganglia circuits
HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE: degeneration of spiny neurons in the striatum
    Breaks the indirect pathway => non-coordinated movements
