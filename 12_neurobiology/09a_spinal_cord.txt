Background
    REFLEX RESPONSE: fast, non-conscious response to stimuli
Functions: sensory, motor, reflexes (but not integrative)
Protection: vertebral column, CSF, meninges
External anatomy
    VERTEBRAL CANAL: canal inside vertebrae containing meninges and spinal cord
    SPINAL NERVE: each of the 31 pairs of nerves (left/right) exiting the spinal cord, innervating the body
        INTERVERTEBRAL FORAMEN: lateral spaces between vertebrae, where spinal nerves exit
        Root: bundle of axons that connect spinal nerves with the spinal cord. One dorsal, one ventral root per nerve
        POSTERIOR ROOT GANGLION: ganglion in the posterior (dorsal) root of nerves, containing cell bodies
    SPINAL SEGMENT: segment of spinal cord from where a certain spinal nerve emerges
        Names matching vertebrae where the nerve exits
        Segment may be more superior than matching vertebra (branches from the spinal cord, goes down, then exits)
        1. Cervical
        2. Thoracic
        3. Lumbar
        4. Sacral
        5. Coccygeal
    Cervical enlargement, lumbar enlargement: set of wider segments (more gray matter), where nerves innervating limbs branch
    Spinal cord does not span the entire vertebral canal (ends ~ L1-L2)
    CONUS MEDULLARIS: cone-like structure where the spinal cord ends (inferior part)
    FILUM TERMINALE: thread-like pia mater extensions, from conus medullaris to coccyx. Anchors the spinal cord
    CAUDA EQUINA: set of spinal nerves that exit below conus medullaris
    PLEXUS: network of axons formed by adjacent spinal nerves
        Most spinal nerves don't directly innervate a concrete body part - they first form plexuses with adjacent nerves
        Cervical, brachial, lumbar, sacral


Horn: region of gray matter within the spinal cord
Column: vertical region of white matter within the spinal cord

white matter outside, gray inside (opposite than in brain)
white matter
    posterior (dorsal), anterior (ventral), lateral columns
    central canal => cerebrospinal fluid
    white commissure => connect both lateral sides. None in posterior
    sensory in dorsal, motor in ventral
gray matter
    anterior horn
    posterior horn
more axons in the cervical segments (more information)
propriospinal neurons: interneurons connecting segments in the spinal cord
covering spinal nerves
    endoneurium (individual axons)
    perineurium (fascicles)
    epineurium (the entire nerve)
plexus: a network of nerves
    e.g. cervical: head, neck, chest
    (all names here not required)
dermatome: part of a body covered by a specific spinal nerve
