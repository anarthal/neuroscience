has no integrative function
medulla oblongata: where the brain starts
does not occupy the entire vertebral column
segments (top to down)
    cervical
    thoracic
    lumbar
    sacral
    coccygeal (only one segment)
the segments in spinal cord does not match the segments in vertebral column
    nerves go outside the vertebral canal, then fork
    the segments of spinal cord receive the name of the matching vertebral column segments where nerves fork
        (as opposed to where the nerve lives)
    one nerve per segment, one segment per vertebra
enlargements => innervation of body structures
    cervical => arms
    lumbar => limb
other structures
    conus medullaris => where the spinal cord ends
    cauda equina => nerves going down from the conus medullaris
white matter outside, gray inside (opposite than in brain)
white matter
    posterior (dorsal), anterior (ventral), lateral columns
    central canal => cerebrospinal fluid
    white commissure => connect both lateral sides. None in posterior
    sensory in dorsal, motor in ventral
gray matter
    anterior horn
    posterior horn
more axons in the cervical segments (more information)
propriospinal neurons: interneurons connecting segments in the spinal cord
covering spinal nerves
    endoneurium (individual axons)
    perineurium (fascicles)
    epineurium (the entire nerve)
plexus: a network of nerves
    e.g. cervical: head, neck, chest
    (all names here not required)
dermatome: part of a body covered by a specific spinal nerve
