Direct motor pathway: starts in cortex. Vs. indirect: starts in brainstem/cerebellum
Neurons
    Upper motor neuron: in cerebral cortex (primary motor area and premotor)
        Premotor plans
        Primary motor executes
        Pyramidal and in layer V
    Basal ganglia spiny neurons: to thalamus, to initiate movements
    Deep cerebellar nuclei: read skeletal muscle position and adjust
    Local interneuron: in spinal cord. Regulate lower motor neuron
    Lower motor neuron: brainstem and spinal cord. The ones that actually synapse with muscle or glands
Tracts
    CORTICOSPINAL TRACT: motor output for the body excepting head (limbs, trunk)
        Lateral (90%): crosses in decussation of the pyramids
        Ventral (10%): crosses in spinal cord
    CORTICOBULBAR TRACT: motor output for the head, face and neck
        Lower motor neuron in brain stem
