direct motor pathway: start in cortex. Vs. indirect: start in brainstem/cerebellum
upper motor neuron: in cerebral cortex (primary motor area and premotor)
    premotor plans
    primary motor executes
    pyramidal and in layer V
basal ganglia spiny neurons
    to thalamus and cerebral cortex
    decide whether to initiate the movement or not
cerebellar neuron: read skeletal muscle position and adjust
local interneuron: regulate
lower motor neuron: brainstem and spinal cord
    the ones that actually do the synapse with muscle or glands
tracts
    corticospinal tract. Limbs, trunk (lower body)
        lateral (90%): crosses in decussation of the pyramids
        ventral (10%): crosses in spinal cord
    corticobulbar tract. Cortex to brain stem (head, face, neck)
        synapses in brainstem
indirect not relevant atm
