Thermoregulatory because brown adipose disappears in adulthood
Hematocrit: analysis to determine % of cells
ECM: plasma
    Mostly water as a solvent
    Albumin: maintains osmotic pressure so diffusion can happen. Also carrier
    Globulin
        Immunoglobulin (gamma): antibody
        Non-immune (alpha, beta): like albumin
    Fibrinogen: coagulation
    Complement proteins: inflammation and immune response
    Serum: plasma - clotting factors (e.g. fibrinogen). For transfusions, so the blood doesn't clot
Cells
    Blood smear usually prepared with eosin + methylene blue (instead of hematoxylin)
    Arteries > arterioles > capillaries
    Erythrocyte
        They don't have a cell
        Shape allows them to travel through capillaries (flexible)
        Cytoplasm full of hemoglobin (Fe and heme) => Bind O2 and CO2
    Leukocytes: leave the blood vessels to perform their function
    Thrombocytes: coagulation
        Derived from megakaryocite: big cell that fragments into platelets
        No nucleus
        Zones
            Peripheral zone: rests of cell membrane and glycocalix (maintain integrity)
            Structural zone: maintain structure
            Organelles
            Membrane systems: rests of the megakaryocyte, what caused it to break
Hemopoiesis/Hematopoiesis: generation of blood
    HSCs: pluripotent/hemopoietic stem cells: differentiate into != cells. Located in bone marrow
        Depending on the cytokine that activates it, differentiates
        Myeloid stem cells/Common myeloid progenitors
            Erythrocytes
            Thrombocytes
            Leukocytes that are not lymphocytes
        Lymphoid stem cells/Common lymphoid progenitors
            B lymphocytes
            T lymphocytes
    Happens in red bone marrow
        Sinusoids: specialized blood vessels where the newly synthesized cells are released
