Background
    CIRCULATORY SYSTEM/VASCULAR SYSTEM: pumps blood and substances. Made up of cardiovascular (blood) and lymphatic systems
    ARTERY: blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart
    VEIN: blood vessel that conducts blood towards the heart
    CAPILLARY: the smallest blood/lymph vessels
    PULMONARY CIRCULATION/MINOR CIRCULATION: between heart and lungs, to oxygenate blood
    SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION/MAJOR CIRCULATION: between heart and the rest of the tissues, to deliver oxygen and nutrients
    Forces exerted on blood in capillaries
        Hydrostatic pressure: tends to pump water outside capillaries
        COLLOID OSMOTIC PRESSURE: exerted by the proteins in blood. Tends to drain water inside the capillaries
        More water pumped out than drained in. Remaining water collected forms lymph, collected in lymphoid capillaries
    LYMPH: the substance in lymphatic vessels. Originally excess interstitial fluid. Ends up in veins
    BLOOD SMEAR: test where a drop of blood is smeared on a slide, stained, and cells observed
        ROMANOWSKY STAINING: eosin + methylene blue (instead of hematoxylin)
Functions
    Transport of nutrients, oxygen, waste, hormones, immune system molecules
    Clotting
    Thermoregulation (because brown adipose disappears in adulthood)
ECM
    PLASMA: ECM of blood
    SERUM: plasma without clotting factors. Still contains antibodies, proteins, ions, hormones... E.g. used in transfusions
    Components
        Water: solvent
        Proteins
            ALBUMIN: maintains colloid osmotic pressure and transports substances
            α, β-globulins: transport substances
            γ-globulins: are antibodies
            FIBRINOGEN: coagulation factor
            Complement proteins: part of the immune system
        Other solutes
            Nutrients (e.g. glucose)
            Respiratory gases (e.g. O2 and CO2)
            Metabolic wastes
            ELECTROLYTES: ions solved in plasma (e.g. Na+)
Cell population
    FORMED ELEMENTS: cell population of blood
    HEMATOCRIT (HCT)/PACKED CELL VOLUME (PCV): volume % of reed blood cells in blood
    ERYTHROCYTES/RED BLOOD CELLS: transport O2 and CO2
        They don't have a nucleus
        Biconcave shape => Maximize cell surface, pass through capillaries (flexible)
        Cytoplasm full of hemoglobin => bind O2 and CO2
        ROULEAUX: stack of erythrocytes formed in larger blood vessels
        Never leave the blood vessel
        ~7.5um diameter
    LEUKOCYTES/WHITE BLOOD CELLS: immune system cells (see i3_cells.txt)
        Leave the blood vessel to perform their function
        Neutrophils
        Eosinophils
        Basophils
        Monocytes
        Natural killer cells
        B lymphocytes
        T lymphocytes
    THROMBOCYTE/PLATELET: involved in clotting
        They don't have a nucleus
        Discoid shape
        Structure
            Peripheral zone: plasma membrane and glycocalyx
            Structural zone: microtubules, actin and myosin filaments that maintain the shape
            Organelle zone: mitochondria, glycogen and granules with coagulation factors
            Membrane zone: channels within the platelet
                OPEN CANALICULAR SYSTEM: remnants of megakaryocyte's membrane. Connects with the plasma membrane
                DENSE TUBULAR SYSTEM: remnants of megakaryocyte's RER. Does not connect with plasma membrane
        MEGAKARYOCYTE: big, multi-nucleated cells that fragment to produce platelets
HEMOPOIESIS/HEMATOPOIESIS: generation of blood cells
    HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL: stem cells that differentiate into != blood cells, driven by cytokines and differentiation factors
        Located in bone marrow
    Myeloid stem cells/Common myeloid progenitors: give raise to myeloid cells
        Erythrocytes
        Thrombocytes
        Granulocytes
        Monocytes
    Lymphoid stem cells/Common lymphoid progenitors: give raise to lymphocytes (natural killer cells, B and T lymphocytes)
    Red bone marrow: where hemopoiesis happens
        SINUSOID: specialized blood vessel where the new cells are released
        Contains adipocytes, sinusoids and developing small cells with dark nucleus
