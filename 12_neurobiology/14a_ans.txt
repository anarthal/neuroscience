2 neuron system: one in the spinal cord, another in a ganglion
    PRE-GANGLION NEURON: soma in CNS. Axon is myelinated
    POST-GANGLION NEURON: soma in PNS (usually in ganglion). Axon is unmyelinated C fiber
    Sympathetic
        Pre-ganglion neuron: in the lateral gray horn. Uses acetylcholine
        Post-ganglion neuron: chain of sympathetic ganglia, next to spinal cord. Uses adrenaline/noradrenaline
        Axon of post-ganglion neuron is long (organ is far away)
    Parasympathetic
        Pre-ganglion neuron: brainstem and sacral portion of the spinal cord. Uses acetylcholine
        Post-ganglion neuron: ganglia next to organs. Uses acetylcholine
AUTONOMIC REFLEXES: measure magnitudes like heart rate, blood pressure... and adjust involuntary processes in consequence
    Sensory neuron => hypothalamus => ANS => effector
Enteric
    Myenteric plexus: movement of the tract
    Submucosal plexus: glands (liver, pancreas)
