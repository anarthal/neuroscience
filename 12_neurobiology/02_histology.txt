Connective tissue: cells + extracellular matrix
    Matrix
        Protein fibers
        Ground substance: liquid/gel substance filling the holes
    Adult stem cells: always located in connective tissue
        Pericyte: stem cell that regenerates endothelial cells
    extracellular matrix
        Collagen fibers: accumulation of collagen fibrils. Depending on the type of fibril
            Fibrillar (type I), the most abundant
            type IV: basal lamina
            type VII: reticular lamina
        Reticular fibers
        Elastic fibers
