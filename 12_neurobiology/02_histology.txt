Epithelium: outer layer
    Gland: epithelial tissue whose main function is to secrete substances, either to lumen or to connective tissue
        Exocrine gland: product secreted to the lumen
            Merocrine: substance surrounded by vesicles (e.g. pancreas)
            Apocrine: substance surrounded by cell membrane (e.g. mamary gland)
            Holocrine: substance liberated by apoptosis when concentration is high (usually in stratified, because cell dies => next layer comes. e.g. sebus)
        Endocrine gland: through the basal domain => connective tissue => blood stream (e.g. hormones)
        For both glands above, and using the same mechanisms above
            Paracrine: reach a close epithelial/connective tissue cell
            Autocrine: reach the same cell that produces the product
                Mechanism of self-regulation: when there's enough product, stop producing product. Negative feedback loop. Doesn't have to be the same molecule as secreted, but it's related
Connective tissue: cells + extracellular matrix
    Continuous along body, supports other tissues (?)
    Cell population embedded in extracellular matrix that fills the gaps
    Vascular: lots of blood vessels
    Matrix
        Protein fibers
        Ground substance: liquid/gel substance filling the holes
    Classified based on the type of extracellular matrix
    Embryonic: embryo and umbilical cord
        Mesenchyme: from mesoderm. Cells suspended in matrix of collagen and reticular fibers
        Mucous: same cells, but suspended in Wharton's jelly, rich in hialuronic acid
    Connective tissue proper: not specialized
        Loose: more cells than matrix
        Dense: more matrix than cells
    Connective tissue cells
        Resident cell population: they're always there
        Transient cell population: they're there only when needed (mostly blood cells)
    Fibroblast: main cell component
        Synthesizes extracellular matrix
        Planar, ellipsoidal shape
    Myofibroblast: intermediate cell type between muscle cells and Fibroblast
        Can contract
    Macrophages: fagocyte pathogens
    Adipocytes: store lipids
        Hematoxin does not stain lipids
        Adipose tissue: tissue with a lot of adipocytes
    Mast cells: cytoplasm full of granules containing inflammation mediators
    Adult stem cells: always located in connective tissue
        Pericyte: stem cell that regenerates endothelial cells
    extracellular matrix
        Collagen fibers: accumulation of collagen fibrils. Depending on the type of fibril
            Fibrillar (type I), the most abundant
            type IV: basal lamina
            type VII: reticular lamina
        Reticular fibers
        Elastic fibers
