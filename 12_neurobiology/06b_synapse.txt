pre-synaptic element: where the action potential arrives. Axon terminal
synaptic cleft: space where neurotransmitters are liberated
post-synaptic element: receives the neurotransmitters. Dendrite, ...
when the action potential arrives, synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters liberated in the synaptic cleft
By localization
    axodendritic: axon to dendrite. E.g. CNS
    axosomatic: axon to cell body
    axoaxonic: axon to axon. Modulates the activation of another axon
By vesicle
(***) By type of conduction
    chemical synapse: uses neurotransmitters. E.g. CNS
    electrical: direct contact between pre/post synaptic elements. Uses gap junctions. E.g. heart
neurotransmitters (there's another lesson)
    acetylcholine: neuromuscular
function
    excitatory: increase the probability of firing action potential
    inhibitory: decrease
    modulatory: regulate neuron activity
(***) process
    vesicle gets to the pre-synaptic terminal, either because it gets generated there or using anterograde transport
    action potential arrives
    Ca2+ channels open, and ions enter the pre-synaptic element
    this causes exocytosis of the vesicles
    neurotransmitters bind to receptors in the post-synaptic element
    this opens ion channels (ligand-based) => depolarization or hyperpolarization
    neurotransmitters removed to avoid over-excitation
ATP used for excocytosis, Na+/K+ pump, Ca2+ pump, recover neurotransmitters
SNARE complex: vesicle fusion
Tripartite synapse: the astrocyte plays an important role in all synapses
    Cleans up neurotransmitters
    Produce lactate for neurons that can be used to produce ATP
Long-term potentiation: increase in strength in synapse by synthesizing new spines and contacts
    vs. Long-term depression
