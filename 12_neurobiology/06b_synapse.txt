PRE-SYNAPTIC ELEMENT: where the action potential arrives (signal emitter). Axon terminal
POST-SYNAPTIC ELEMENT: the target of the signal (receptor). E.g. dendrite
SYNAPTIC CLEFT: extracellular space between pre and post synaptic elements, where synapse takes place
By localization
    Axodendritic: axon to dendrite. E.g. CNS
    Axosomatic: axon to cell body. E.g. muscle
    Axoaxonic: axon to axon. Modulates the activation of another axon
By type of conduction
    CHEMICAL SYNAPSE: uses neurotransmitters
        Slow
        Unidirectional
        E.g. CNS
    ELECTRICAL SYNAPSE: direct contact between pre/post synaptic elements. Uses gap junctions
        Fast
        Bidirectional
        E.g. heart, smooth muscle, retina
By function
    Excitatory: increase the probability of firing action potential
    Inhibitory: decrease the probability of firing action potential
    Modulatory: regulate neuron activity
Process
    1. Vesicle with neurotransmitter gets to the pre-synaptic terminal, either because it gets generated there or using anterograde transport
    2. Action potential arrives => depolarization of pre-synaptic element
    3. Ca2+ channels (voltage-gated) open => Ca2+ enters the pre-synaptic element
    4. This causes exocytosis of the vesicles
    5. Neurotransmitters bind to receptors (ligand-gated channels) in the post-synaptic element => Depolarization or hyperpolarization
    6. Neurotransmitters removed to avoid over-excitation
    ATP used for excocytosis, Na+/K+ pump, Ca2+ pump, recover neurotransmitters
SNARE complex: vesicle fusion
Tripartite synapse: the astrocyte plays an important role in all synapses
    Cleans up and recycles neurotransmitters
    Regulates neuron activity
    Produce lactate for neurons that can be used to produce ATP
Long-term potentiation: increase in strength in synapse by synthesizing new spines and contacts
    vs. Long-term depression
