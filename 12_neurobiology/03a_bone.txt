ECM
    Mineralized => hard
    HYDROXYAPATITE CRYSTAL: calcium phosphate crystals conferring hardness to the bone matrix
    Fibers: type I collagen, but we can't observe it in regular preparations because of the amount of crystals
    Ground substance
        Osteoadherin (proteoglycan): binds to crystals => maintain structure
        Osteonectin (multiadhesive glycoprotein): glue collagen <=> crystals
        Cytokines
MATURE COMPACT BONE: bone formed by concentric lamina
    LACUNAE: small spaces in the bone matrix where mature cells reside
    CANALICULI: smaller canals communicating different lacunae
    LAMELLAE: layer of bone where all collagen fibers have the same direction. Cylindrical arrangement
    HARVESIAN CANAL/OSTEONAL CANAL: central canal containing blood supply and nerves. Lamellae organized concentrically around it
    CONCENTRIC LAMELLAE: lamellae arranged around a Harvesian canal
    OSTEON: system containing the osteonal canal and all concentric lamellae around it
        Lacunae's long axis parallel to Harvesian canal
        Canaliculi mostly radial
        Harvesian canal mostly parallel to bone's long axis
    INTERSTITIAL LAMELLAE: lamellae belonging to an osteon that is no longer there due to bone remodelling
    CIRCUMFERENTIAL LAMELLAE: lamellae surrounding the entire bone
    VOLKMANN CANAL/PERFORATING CANAL: communicates != Harvesian canals. Also contains blood supply and nerves
    PERIOSTEUM: layer of connective tissue that covers the outer surface of bones
        Not present in articulations (hyaline cartilage instead)
    ENDOSTEUM: layer of connective tissue that covers the inner surface of bones
        Separates compact and spongy bone, covers trabeculae in spongy bone
MATURE SPONGY BONE: same organization forming osteons, but arranged forming cavities
    Contains the bone marrow
    Trabecula/spicule: each bone protrusion creating the cavities in spongy bone
IMMATURE BONE: forms the skeleton in the fetus
    Not organized in lamellae
    Has more cells
    ECM has more ground substance
By shape: long, short, flat, irregular
Long bone structure
    Outer part compact bone, inner part spongy bone containing bone marrow
    EPIPHYSIS: in long bone, the farthest part. Mostly spongy bone. Articular cartilage on top
    DIAPHYSIS: the main shaft. Mostly compact bone
    METAPHYSIS: join point between both
    MARROW CAVITY: spongy bone component of bones, containing the bone marrow
    RED BONE MARROW: network of fibers and developing blood cells
    YELLOW BONE MARROW: bone marrow that is no longer active, filled by adipocytes
        Red bone marrow replaced by yellow in adulthood
Cells
    OSTEOPROGENITOR CELL: multipotent cells, in periosteum or bone surfaces. Flattened
        Derived from mesenchymal cells
    OSTEOBLAST: cell actively secreting bone matrix
        Derived from osteoprogenitor cells
        OSTEOID: bone matrix that has not yet been mineralized
        1. Synthesize all ECM components except minerals (osteoid)
        2. Produce vesicles containing the crystals
    OSTEOCYTE: osteoblast completely surrounded by bone matrix, creating lacunae
        Active cells that can respond to mechanical stress
        Quiescent: not metabolically active
        Formative: actively secreting ECM
        Resorptive: participate in bone resorption
    BONE-LINING CELL: form the periosteum/endosteum
        Differentiated from osteoblasts
        PERIOSTEAL CELL: form the periosteum
        ENDOSTEAL CELL: form the endosteum
    OSTEOCLAST: perform bone resorption
        Derived from monocytes
        Large, multi-nucleated
Bone formation
    Endochondral ossification: from a cartilage primer
        Osteoprogenitor cells surround the diaphysis and differentiate to osteoblasts
        Osteoblasts ossificates the cartilage => bony collar
        Osteoblasts penetrate the cartilage => primary ossification center
        Osteoblasts travel to the epiphysis => secondary ossification center
        Centers connected, in epiphyseal growth plate => Epiphyseal plate
    INTRAMEMBRANOUS OSSIFICATION: without the cartilage primer
Growth directions
    Apositional growth: in width
    Interstitial growth: in height, by endochondral ossification
Bone remodelling
    Cutting cone: osteoclasts remove bone
    Closing cone: osteoblasts synthesize new bone
    Bone formed in response to physical stress

highly regulated process by PTH
also serve as Ca2+ reservoir
