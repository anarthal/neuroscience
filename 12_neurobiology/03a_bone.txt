extracellular matrix is mineralized => hard
Hydroxyapatite crystals: calcium phosphate, crystalized
ECM composed of type I collagen, but we can't observe it in regular preparations because of the amount of crystals
    Osteoadherin: binds to crystals => maintain structure
    Osteoconectin: glue collagen <=> crystals
    K-dependent proteins
    Cytokines
Lacunae: hole where the cell resides, because ECM is hard
    Communicate to each other through tunnels: canaliculi

Mature compact bone
    central canal (Harvesian/osteonal canal). center, contains veins/nerves
    concentric lamellae (lÃ¡minas)
    Lacunae: holes containing the cells
    canaliculi: small canals communicating lacunae
    osteons: central canal, lamellae, canaliculi
    Transversal canal: Volkmann: communicates != osteons
    Lamellae rests of previous osteons: insterstitial (not concentric)
        as long as you see the whole circle, it's concentric, otherwise insterstitial
    Bone covered by connective tissue proper
    periosteum: connective tissue proper surrounding the bone
Mature spongy bone: same ECM, != arrangement
    Trabeculae/spicules: structure with a lot of holes containing bone marrow
Immature bone: in the fetus
    more cells, without arrangement
Bone marrow
    red: while developing, lots of blood cells are being generated
    yellow: in adulthood, because less blood cells generated, replaced by adipocytes
Organ
    Epiphysis: the farthest part of the bone. Made of spongy bone. Articular cartilage on top
    Diaphysis: the main shaft. Made of compact bone
    Metaphysis: join point between both
Bone cells
    Osteoprogenitor cells: multipotent cells
    Osteoblast: secrete the bone matrix
        1st synthesize all components except minerals => osteoid
        2nd vesicles containing the crystals
    Osteocyte: differentiated from osteoblasts
        In lacunae
    Bone-lining cells: form the periosteum/endosteum. differentiated from the osteoblasts
        smaller population than osteoblasts
    Osteoclast: bone resorption
        They don't come from mesenchyma, ~ fagocyte (hematopoietic)
        highly regulated process by PTH
Bone formation:
    endochondral ossification (cartilage primer)
        cartilage model
        osteoprogenitor cells surround it and differentiate to osteoblasts
        osteoblasts ossificates the cartilage => bony collar
        osteoblasts penetrate the cartilage => primary ossification center (diaphysis)
        osteoblasts travel to the epiphysis => secondary ossification center
        centers connected => finished
apositional growth => in width, vs. interstitial growth
bone remodelling
    cutting cone: osteoclasts remove bone
    closing cone: osteoblasts synthesize new bone
    bone formed in response to physical stress
also serve as Ca2+ reservoir
