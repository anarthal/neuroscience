pituitary gland / hypophysis: produces hormones
2 neuron system: one in the spinal cord, another in a ganglion
    sympathetic
        pre-ganglion neuron: in the lateral gray horn
        post-ganglion neuron: in the ganglion (connected, most of them ventral, outside)
    parasympathetic
        pre-ganglion neuron: in the spinal cord at the end, and in the brainstem
        post-ganglion neuron: ganglia next to organs
reflexes: control loop to regulate blood pressure and similar
enteric
    myenteric plexus: movement of the tract
    submucosal plexus: glands (liver, pancreas)
hypophysis is a gland, not neurons
hypothalamus: the regulator of ANS, part of diencephalon
    info <=> spinal cord, brainstem, cerebral cortex and limbic system
    controls glucose, osmolarity, hormones, temperature
    reads melatonin and controls circadian rhythms
    involved in autonomic response to emotions
    regulates appetite
portal system: how hypothalamus controls hormone production
    network of capillaries surround the gland
    neurons release neurotransmitters onto smooth muscle of capillaries, then into the blood
pituitary gland/hypophysis
    infundibulum: connects hypophysis and hypothalamus
    adenohypophysis: epithelian (gland) cells (the ones that go through portal system)
    neurohypophysis: axons of hypothalamus neurons that secrete hormones directly into the blood
    controlled by hypothalamus and negative feedback loop
