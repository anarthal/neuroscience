these signals may
    spinal cord: reflexes
    brainstem: reflexes for heartbeat, etc
    cerebral cortex: conscious
receptors based on microscopic structure
    free nerve endings: no receptor (pain, temperature)
    encapsulated nerve endings: nerve surrounded by connective tissue (pressure, vibration)
    specialized receptors (special senses)
receptors based on location
    exteroreceptors: outside/near outside
    interoreceptors: blood vessels, organs..
    proprioreceptors: muscles, tendons and inner ear (equilibrium)
receptors based on type of stimulus
    mechanoreceptors
    thermoreceptors
    nociceptor: pain
    photoreceptor: light
    chemoreceptor: chemicals in mouth, bloodstream
glabra skin contains more mechanoreceptors than hair skin
thermoreceptors: in the base of the epidermis
    cold receptors: 10 < T < 35. Adelta and C fibers (faster)
    warm receptors: 35 < T < 50. Only C fibers (slower)
nociceptor: free nerve endings (Adelta, C) in every tissue except brain
    Intense thermal, mechanical, chemical stimuli (damage)
visceral pain: nerves from organ converge with the skin receptors on top of it => we feel it in the skin
propioreceptors
    muscle spindle: detects changes in muscle fiber length
    golgi tendon organ: detects tendon extension and prevents excessive extension
    joints: detects joint position
tracts
    all tracts are: 1st order in ganglion (PNS), 2nd order in brainstem, 3rd order in thalamus
    trigeminothalamic tract: somatic info for face
    posterior column tract: ascending info in the posterior part of the spinal cord. Carries somatic info for limbs, abdomen...
    somatotopic: axons don't cross, in parallel. 1st dorsal root, 2nd medulla oblongata, 3rd thalamus
    anterolateral: temperature and pain for body (not face). crosses in spinal cord
