Background
    GLABRA SKIN: skin without hair
Receptors based on microscopic structure
    Free nerve endings: dendrites of 1st order neurons have ion channels that capture the stimulus (pain, temperature)
    Encapsulated nerve endings: nerve ending surrounded by connective tissue (pressure, vibration)
    Specialized receptors: have a specialized cell as receptor (special senses)
Receptors based on location
    Exteroreceptors: at/near the skin or body surface
    Interoreceptors/visceroreceptors: in blood vessels, internal organs...
    Proprioceptors: muscles, tendons and inner ear. Info about position of muscles, joints...
Mechanoreceptors: more in glabra skin than in hair skin
Thermoreceptors: in the base of the epidermis
    Cold receptors: 10 < T < 35. Adelta and C fibers (faster)
    Warm receptors: 35 < T < 50. Only C fibers (slower)
NOCIRECEPTOR: receptors for pain
    Everywhere in the body except brain
    Detect mechanical, chemical or thermal damaging stimuli (e.g. molecules from damaged cells)
    Free nerve endings
    Adelta/C fibers
    VISCERAL PAIN: pain originating in internal organs
    REFERRED PAIN: situation where we identify visceral pain as coming from the skin on top of the organ that is actually experiencing it
Propioceptors
    KINESTHESIA: perception of the body's self position (e.g. muscle state, joint position)
    Muscle spindle: detects changes in muscle fiber length
    Golgi tendon organ: detects tendon extension to prevents excessive extension
    Joint receptor: detects joint position
Path to the brain
    All tracts are: 1st order in ganglion (PNS), 2nd order in brainstem, 3rd order in thalamus
    SOMATOTOPIC INFORMATION: axons in the tract are grouped according to what they innervate
    Trigeminothalamic tract: somatic info for face across trigeminal nerve
        1st: trigeminal ganglion
        2nd: pons
        3rd: thalamus
    Posterior column tract: touch, proprioception for limbs and trunk. Somatotopic
        1st: dorsal root ganglion
        2nd: gracile and cuneate nuclei (ascends through spinal cord's posterior column)
        3rd: thalamus
    Anterolateral tract: temperature and pain
        1st: dorsal root ganglion
        2nd: posterior gray horn
        3rd: thalamus
