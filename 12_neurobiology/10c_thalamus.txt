THALAMUS: main relay station to/from the cerebral cortex. Part of the diencephalon
Anatomy
    On top of the midbrain
    Has left/right lobes, separated by the 3rd ventricle
    INTERTHALAMIC ADHESION: mass of gray matter that connects both thalamus units, through the 3rd ventricle
    INTERNAL MEDULLARY LAMINA: internal surface of white matter dividing each lobe in two
    INTERNAL CAPSULE: thick band of white matter connecting thalamus <=> cerebral cortex
        Above the thalamus, between caudate nucleus and lentiform nuclei
Neurons
    Relay neurons
        Neurotransmitter: glutamate (excitatory)
    Interneurons: modulate relay neurons
        Neurotransmitter: GABA (inhibitory)
