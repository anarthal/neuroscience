RESTING POTENTIAL: potential != across cell membrane, when no action potential present. Neurons: -70mV
Ion channel types
    VOLTAGE-GATED ION CHANNEL: open/close depending on membrane potential
    LIGAND-GATED ION CHANNEL: open/close depending on a ligand (e.g. neurotransmitter)
    Mechanosensitive and heat sensitive channels: open/close depending on pressure or heat. Important for senses
Ion channels are specific to ion species
    Intracellular rich in K+, outside rich in Na+
    K+ leak channel: leaks K+ ions outside. Voltage-gated
    Na+ leak channel: leaks Na+ ions inside. Voltage-gated
    Na/K pump: uses ATP To pump 3 Na+ ions outside, 2 K+ ions inside => Makes the interior more negative
ACTION POTENTIAL: short event that causes the membrane potential of a neuron to be reversed for a short period of time
    Causes the transmission of a signal along the axon
    PLASMA MEMBRANE THRESHOLD: if the neuron's potential raises above this value (-50mV), an action potential gets generated (all or none)
    1. An external event (e.g. signal from other neuron) causes potential to raise above threshold
    2. Depolarization phase: Na+ leak channel opens because of voltage increase => lets Na+ out, increases voltage
    3. Repolarization phase: when voltage reaches a certain value, Na+ channels close and K+ open => decrease voltage until resting potential
    4. Hyperpolarization phase: voltage goes even further down because of K+ exit. K+ channel ends up closing, Na/K pump restores resting potential
REFRACTORY PERIOD: period where a neuron can't be excited to generate a new action potential
    ABSOLUTE REFRACTORY PERIOD: during action potential generation (depolarization and repolarization). Because Na channels can't be activated
    RELATIVE REFRACTORY PERIOD: during hyperpolarization. Because K channels are still open
        A stimuli can initiate an action potential, but it needs to be stronger
Saltatory conduction: along myelin-covered axons
    Fast, energy-efficient signal conduction
    Signal re-generated by ion channels in Ranvier nodes
    Uni-directional because of refractory period
Continuous conduction: along non-myelin-covered axons (e.g. pain)
    Slow, energy-inefficient
    Signal gets regenerated continuously
Conduction in dendrite
    Passive diffusion of ions (no ion channels)
    Detrimental: intensity goes down with space
    Bidirectional conduction
    Low speed
Conduction faster if
    Fibers are wider
    Fibers are more myelinated
    Distance between Ranvier nodes is longer
    Ranvier nodes themselves are shorter
Multiple sclerosis: the immune system attacks myelin in the central nervous system
Guillain-Barr√© syndrome: same but in the peripheral nervous system
