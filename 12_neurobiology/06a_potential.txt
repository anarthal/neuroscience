inner part is more negative
equilibrium between concentrations outside/inside
intracellular rich in K+, outside rich in Na+
K+ leak channel: leaks K+ ions outside
Na+ leak channel: leaks Na+ ions inside
Na/K pump: uses ATP To pump Na+ ions outside, K+ ions inside
voltage-gated ion channels: open/close depending on membrane potential
ligand-gated ion channels: open/close depending on a ligand, like glutamate
    E.g. neurotransmitters are ligands
mechanosensitive/heat sensitive channels: open/close depending on pressure or heat. Important for senses
action potential: short event that causes the membrane potential of a neuron to be reversed for a short period of time
    potential decreases because an external event, e.g. neurotransmitters, until above a threshold
    depolarization: the Na+ leak channel opens because of the voltage increase, lets Na+ out, increases voltage
    repolarization: voltage reaches a certain threashold, closes the Na+ channel and opens the K+ one. Potential goes down
    hyperpolarization: voltage goes even further down because of K+ exit
    back to resting potential: uses Na+/K+ to restore initial conditions
all or none: if the potential reaches the threshold, an action potential fires. Otherwise, it does not
refractory period: neuron can't generate another action potential in this phase
    absolute and relative
Saltatory conduction: along myelin-covered axons
    In myelin-covered parts, the electric signal travels fast
    In Ranvier nodes (non-myelin covered), the signal gets re-generated by ion channels
    Uni-directional because refractory period
    Fast and efficient
Continuous conduction: along non-myelin-covered axons
    Much slower, action potential gets regenerated continuously
Conduction in dendrite
    Passive, bidirectional conduction
    Intensity goes down with space
Multiple sclerosis: the immune system attacks myelin in the central nervous system
Guillain-Barr√© syndrome: same but in the peripheral nervous system
!= types of axons
