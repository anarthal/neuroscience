Neuron
    Post-mitotic (there are some stem cells)
    soma: cell body
    Dendrites: receiving part of the neuron
        dendritic tree: all the branches of a dendrite
        wider diameter than axon
        decreasing potential: when a signal is received, the potential is higher in the apical ends of the dendrite than in the soma
    dendritic spine: protrusions of dendrite's spine
        where synaptic connection takes place
        dynamic: fast assembly and degradation
    axon
        sends a signal from the hillock to the end of the axon
    axon hillock: communicates body with axon
        microtubule organizing center
            is the negative end of microtubule organization: where they are degraded
            positive end is in the axon
        lots of mitochondria
    schwann cells: glial cells that cover the axon
    synapse junction
    euchromatic nucleus: requires a lot of energy
    nissl bodies: rER + ribosomes (they need to synthesize proteins)
    lots of mitochondria
    neurofilaments: specialized type of intermediate filaments
    types
        multipolar: several dendrites. E.g. motor
        bipolar: just one long dendrite, then forks. Less common. E.g. sensory
        pseudounipolar: fast response. The action potential starts before reaching the cell body
    types according to functioning
        sensory: receive info from env
        motor neuron: produce action to skeletal muscle
        interneuron: the rest
    circuits
        divergent: information extension
        convergent: 
        feedback
    neuronal transport: moves cargos and organelle
        anterograde: from body to axon (to +). Kinesins
            fast: mitochondria, synaptic vesicles
            slow: e.g. membrane proteins
        retrograde: from axon to body (to -). Dyneins
Glia (glue): smaller, non-conductive
    Supportive function
    Higher proportion to neurons
    synthesizes ECM: almost only ground substance
    Capable of mitotic division
    Astrocytes, microglia, 
Astrocyte
    Metabolic support
    Electric isolation
    Blood-brain barrier
    Protoplasmic astrocyte: large, non-overlapping
    Fibrous astrocyte
    Readial glia: multipotent cell, can differentiate into neurons or glia
    Generate glial scar
        Proliferate when there is an injury to isolate damage
        Excess proliferation can cause neurodegeneration
Microglia: immune cells
    protection against pathogens, removal of debris
    remodeling of synapses
Oligodendrocyte
    myelin production => isolation of axons
Ependymal cell
    Physical barrier
    produce cerebral fluid
Myelin does not stain because it has a high lipid content
Schwann cells: in the peripheral nervous system
    produce myelin
satellite cell: like microglia, but in the peripheral neural system
enteric glia: next to intestine
Myelination
    Covers axons
    Isolate the axon electrically
    Increases the speed of electrical transmission
Blood-brain barrier: selective barrier that allows the passage of nutrients and ions, but not pathogens and other cells
    Formed by endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes
