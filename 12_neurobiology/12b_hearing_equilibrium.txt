hearing: mechanical receptors for vibration
external ear: collecting sound
middle ear: transmission
    tympanic membrane
    small bones for transmission
inner ear: receptors
    cochlea: hearing
    vestibule: equilibrium
    one nerve branch for each
physiology
    sound wave enters external ear
    tympanic membrane vibrates
    the 3 ossicles transmit and amplify the vibration
    transmits to fluid in the inner ear
    this leads to deformation of hair cells in the cochlea
cochlea is a spiral canal, with 3 sections
    vestibular ramp: perilymph
    cochlear ramp: endolymph
    tympanic ramp: perilymph
    perilymph: high Na+, low K+ (~ extracellular)
    endolymph: low Na+, high K+ (~ intracellular)
    corti organ: contains the cells for transduction
    basilar membrane: separates tympanic and cochlear, receptors on top
    inner hair cells: most of them
    outer hair cells: for frequency
    hair cells have stereocillia that are connected to each other
    there is a membrane on top of them. The membrane width changes, so it's sensitive to frequency
    when they move to one side, they depolarize => nerve impulse. The other side causes hyperpolarization
    movement leads to K+ channel opening => depolarization => glutamate release
inner ear for equilibrium
    semicircular canals
    receptors are in utricle and saccule
    receptors are crystals named otoliths
    otoliths move when there is movement and press hair cells
    semicircular canals don't have otoliths but have receptors, and work with a cupule that moves
    one cupule for each canal
    transduction the same as for hearing
transduction
    1st order neuron: near the hair cells
    2nd order neuron: medulla oblongata (cochlear/vestibular nucleus)
    3rd order neuron: thalamus/cerebellum
