Background
    HYALURONAN = hyaluronic acid
    FIBRILLIN: protein part of elastic fibers
    SACCHARIDE/CARBOHYDRATE: molecule with form ~Cx(H2O)y (i.e. hydrated carbon)
    MONOSACCHARIDE: smaller saccharide units (monomers)
    GLYCAN/POLYSACCHARIDE: polymer consisting of several monosaccharides joined together
    GLYCOPROTEIN: protein containing saccharides
    PROTEOGLYCAN: special case of glycoprotein, with a long protein core and GAGs attached to it (brush-like)
    TENDON: connective tissue that joins muscle to bone
    LIGAMENT: connective tissue that joins bones
Definition: consists of cell population embedded within extracellular matrix
Vascular tissue (has blood vessels)
Connects and supports other tissues
Classification: according to ECM
    Embryonic
        MESENCHYME: from mesoderm. Generates most of other tissues, like blood or bone
            Cells: mesenchymal cells (spindle-shaped cytoplasm)
            ECM: collagen and reticular fibers
        MUCOUS CONNECTIVE TISSUE: in umbilical cord
            Cells: mesenchymal cells
            ECM (Wharton's jelly): hyaluronic acid, collagen, reticular fibers
    Connective tissue proper: not specialized
        Loose: more cells/ECM than fibers. Easy diffusion => close to glands, blood vessels and epithelia. Low tensile strength
        Dense: more fibers than cells/ECM
            Irregular: fibers randomly oriented. Equal tensile strength in all directions. Usually below loose
            Regular: parallel fibers. High tensile strength in one direction. E.g. tendon, ligament
    Specialized: cartilage, bone, blood, lymphatic...
Cell population
    Resident: always located there
        FIBROBLAST: synthesize ECM. Long cytoplasm. The main ones
        MYOFIBROBLAST: intermediate between fibroblasts and muscle cells
            Involved in wound healing: contract wound so it can close, synthesize collagen to repair
        Macrophage: immune response
        ADIPOCYTE: stores fat and secretes hormones
            With H&E, lipids not stained => white
        MAST CELL: immune response. Contains basophilic granules with inflammation mediators
        Adult/mesenchymal stem cells: rare, in specific locations
        PERICYTE: adult stem cell living in the basement membrane of capillaries. Regenerative functions
    Transient/wandering: temporarily located there. Mainly blood cells
EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX: medium where cells in connective tissue live
    Protein fibers
        Collagen fibers: main structural component
            Tensile strength
            Mainly type I, also FACITs
            Stains pink with H&E
        RETICULAR FIBERS/RETICULIN: structural support in lymphatic tissue
            Type III collagen
            Requires special stain, e.g. silver
        Elastic fibers: add elastic deformation capabilities
            Fibrillin and elastin
            Requires special stain
    Ground substance: fills the gaps between cells and fibers. Water-rich. Allows diffusion of molecules, protects against invaders
        GLYCOSAMINOGLYCAN (GAG): long linear polysaccharide consisting of disaccharide monomers
            E.g. hyaluronan: very long
            Negatively charged => Attracts water, confers ground substance its physical properties
        Proteoglycan: e.g. aggrecan
            PROTEOGLYCAN AGGREGATE: several proteoglycans attached to a hyaluronan molecule
        Multiadhesive glycoproteins: cell-ECM adhesion. E.g. fibronectin
        INTERSTITIAL FLUID: water within the ground substance. Similar ion contents than plasma
