Definition: consists of cell population embedded within extracellular matrix
Vascular tissue (has blood vessels)
Connects and supports other tissues
Classification: according to ECM
    Embryonic
        MESENCHYME: from mesoderm. Generates most of other tissues, like blood or bone
            Cells: mesenchymal cells (spindle-shaped cytoplasm)
            ECM: collagen and reticular fibers
        MUCOUS CONNECTIVE TISSUE: in umbilical cord
            Cells: mesenchymal cells
            ECM: hyaluronic acid, collagen, reticular fibers
    Connective tissue proper: not specialized
        Dense: more fibers than cells
        Loose: more cells than fibers
    Specialized: cartilage, bone, blood, lymphatic...
Cell population
    Resident: always located there
        FIBROBLAST: synthesize ECM. Long cytoplasm. The main ones
        MYOFIBROBLAST: intermediate between fibroblasts and muscle cells
            Involved in wound healing: contract wound so it can close, synthesize collagen to repair
        Macrophage: immune response
        ADIPOCYTE: stores fat and secretes hormones
            With H&E, lipids not stained => white
        MAST CELL: immune response. Contains basophilic granules with inflammation mediators
        Adult stem cells: rare, in specific locations. Specific to connective tissue
        

    Transient/wandering: temporarily located there. Mainly blood cells
EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX: medium where cells in connective tissue live
