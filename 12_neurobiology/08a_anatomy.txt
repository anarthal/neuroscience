central: brain and spinal cord
    brain
        cerebrum
        diencephalon
        cerebellum
        brain stem
    spinal cord
peripheral: rest
    somatic: voluntary
        actions for skeletal muscle
        receives sensations
    autonomic: involuntary. Receives info from internal organs
        sympathetic: fight or flight response
        parasympathetic: rest and digest
        enteric: moves the smooth muscle in the intestine tract
sensory division
    somatic senses: touch
    special senses: hearing, vision, equilibrium...
each motor output associated with a neurotransmitter
medulla oblongata = bulbo raquÃ­deo
plexus: arrangement of nerves (?)
protection
    cranial bones
    vertebral column: joined by ligaments
    meninges: connective tissue
        dura matter/pachymeninge: dense irregular tissue, attached to the periosteum
        arachnoides: collagen and elastic fibers
        pia mater: internal layer, vascularized
    epidural space: between vertebra and dura matter. Adipose tissue, highly vascularized
    subdural space: dura matter-arachnoides
    subarachnoid space: arachnoides-pia mater: where cerebro-spinal fluid is
blood vessels
    internal carotid: frontal supply
    right vertebral: caudal, spinal cord, brain stem supply
blood-brain barrier: selective
    much more isolated than other organs (to prevent infections)
    drugs difficult to transport
    astrocyte endfeet: the end of the astrocytes that end in the capillaries
    permeable to lipid-soluble, water, gas, hormones
    non-permeable: water-soluble and toxins
    permeability can be altered under certain conditions
ventricular system
    contains cerebospinal fluid
    most waste is discarded by this fluid
    choroid plexus: where cerebrospinal fluid is formed
CSF
    protection
    waste removal
    transport
    signalling
    choroid plexus => lateral ventricles => 3rd ventricle => 4th ventricle => central canal of spinal cord => subarachnoid space => veins
    ependymal cells (glia): in the walls of ventricles
