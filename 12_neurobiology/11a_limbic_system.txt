Components
    Amygdala (cerebrum)
    Hippocampus (cerebrum)
    Thalamus (diencephalon)
    Hypothalamus (diencephalon)
    Insula lobe (cerebrum)
Related
    Nucleus accumbens (basal ganglia)
    Cingulate gyrus (cerebrum)
    Olfactory bulb (cerebrum)
Olfaction is the sense more linked to emotions
Memory, depending on acquisition time
    Short-term: based on action potentials
    Long-term: based on structural changes in synapses
        DECLARATIVE MEMORY: conscious storage of info that can be told to others (e.g. dates). In prefrontal cortex
        PROCEDURAL MEMORY: unconscious storage on how to do things (e.g. play an instrument). In cerebellum, premotor area, basal ganglia
    MEMORY CONSOLIDATION: transforming a short-term memory into a long-term one
Learning
    ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING: connection of two stimuli (e.g. Pavlov's dog)
    NON-ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING: repeated exposition to a stimuli changes our response to it (e.g. habituation, sensitization)
AMYGDALA: almond-shaped nucleus at the end of the caudate nucleus, below putamen
    Functions: emotions and memory
    Connections
        Prefrontal cortex: higher-order processing of emotions (e.g. make decisions)
        Hypothalamus and brainstem: autonomic responses to emotions
        Hippocampus: memories related to emotions
    Overactivation: anxiety, depression
    Damage: autism
    Anatomy
        Basal-lateral group (the biggest): connected to prefrontal cortex and hippocampus
        Medial group: link odors to emotions
        Central group: autonomic responses
HIPPOCAMPUS: structure below caudate nucleus' tail and amygdala
    Functions: memory consolidation, learning, spatial navigation (GPS)
    Connections
        Amygdala: memories related to emotions
        Hypothalamus: learning under stress
        Association cortexes: storing long-term memories
        Thalamus
    The first region that degenerates in Alzheimer
NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS: reward system (dopamine)
    Involved in addictions: activation of nucleus accumbens links addiction to pleasure
    Connections
        Midbrain: generates pleasure as reward
        Prefrontal cortex: regulates nucleus accumbens
        Amygdala: emotions linked to rewards
        Hippocampus: memories related to emotions linked to rewards
