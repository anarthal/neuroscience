insula lobe: part of the cortex involved in limbic system
olfactory bulb related: the special sense that evokes more emotions
amygdala
    part of the cerebrum but not the cortex
    corticomedial group: linked to olfactory
    basal-lateral group: the one more evolved in humans, linked to conscious behavior?
    connected to
        prefrontal cortex: make decisions in emotional responses
        hippocampus: establish emotional memories
        hypothalamus and brain stem: non-voluntary responses to emotions (e.g. heart rate)
    overactivation: depression, stress, phobias
    damage: autism-like


hippocampus
    part of the cerebrum but not the cortex
    related to spatial navigation (GPS)
    involved in generation of memories (but does not store them)
    converts short-term to long-term memories (and seems to be the only region with that capability)
    grid cells: store where in space you are

short-term memory does not involve structural (synapse) changes (only action potentials), while long-term memories are

nucleus accumbens: reward system (dopamine)
