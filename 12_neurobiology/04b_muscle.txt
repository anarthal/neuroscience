Background
    SYNCYTIUM: multi-nucleated cell
Types
    STRIATED MUSCLE: organized in a single direction. Cells show cross-striations
        SKELETAL MUSCLE: attached to bone, for movement
        VISCERAL STRIATED MUSCLE: like skeletal muscle, but not attached to bone. In soft tissues: tongue, pharynx...
        CARDIAC MUSCLE: heart and veins close to heart
    SMOOTH MUSCLE: cells don't show cross-striations
Skeletal muscle
    MYOBLAST: muscle cell precursors. Many myoblasts fuse to form a single muscle cell
    MUSCLE FIBER/MYOCYTE: multi-nucleated muscle cell. Long, cylindrical
        SARCOLEMMA: cytoplasm of muscle cells
        SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM: endoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells. Stores Ca2+
        Nuclei immediately below the cell membrane
    MUSCLE FASCICLE: group of muscle fibers working together
    ENDOMYSIUM: thin layer of connective tissue surrounding individual fibers
        Contains reticular fibers and fibroblasts
    PERIMYSIUM: layer of connective tissue surrounding a fascicle
    EPIMYSIUM: layer of dense irregular connective tissue surrounding the entire muscle (collection of fascicles)
    MYOFIBRIL: each of the longitudinal subunits in a muscle fiber
        Z-lines in != myofibrils are not aligned with each other
    SARCOMERE: each functional unit of a myofibril. Myofibrils composed of several longitudinal sarcomeres
    Z-DISC/Z-LINE: dark band delimiting sarcomeres, perpendicular to myofibril axis. Many != proteins
    MYOFILAMENTS: protein filaments that make up the sarcomere
        THIN FILAMENTS: composed of actin and regulatory proteins. Anchored to the Z-line. 
        THICK FILAMENTS: composed of myosin II. Slide within thin filaments
    I-BAND: lighter band surrounding the Z-line. Isotropic. Contains thin filaments
    A-BAND: darker band between two I-bands. Anisotropic. Contains both thin and thick filaments
    H-BAND: slightly lighter band in the middle of an A band. Contains only thick filaments
    ACTOMYOSIN CROSS-BRIDGE CYCLE: mechanism of muscle contraction
        Thick filaments slide through thin filaments
        Ca2+ ions involved in regulation
    NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION: synapse site between neuron and muscle fiber. Controls voluntary movement
Cardiac muscle
    Shorter, mono-nucleated cells (fibers)
    Organized in myofibrils and sarcomeres, like skeletal muscle
    INTERCALATED DISCS: specialized structure where cardiac cells attach to each other
        Staircase-like structure, with transverse and lateral components
        FASCIA ADHERENS: attach the end of the last sarcomere (actin filaments) to plasma membrane
            Similar to zonula adherens in epithelial
            Only found in transverse component
        Macula adherens: attach cells to each other. In both components
        Gap junction: for communication. Only in lateral component
    PURKINJE FIBER: specialized cardiac muscle cell that coordinates the contraction of the other cells
        Regulated by the autonomous nervous system
Smooth muscle: involuntary muscle that surrounds organs. E.g. intestine
    Slow, steady contraction
    Fusiform, non-striated cells with central, elongated nucleus
    DENSE BODY: structure in cytoplasm where actin filaments are anchored. Anchored to cytoskeleton and membrane
    Network of actin and myosin filaments in the cytoplasm make the whole cell contract
        Less organized than skeletal muscle (no directionality)
