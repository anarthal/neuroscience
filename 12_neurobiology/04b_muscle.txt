Background
    SYNCYTIUM: multi-nucleated cell
Types
    STRIATED MUSCLE: organized in a single direction. Cells show cross-striations
        SKELETAL MUSCLE: attached to bone, for movement
        VISCERAL STRIATED MUSCLE: like skeletal muscle, but not attached to bone. In soft tissues: tongue, pharynx...
        CARDIAC MUSCLE: heart and veins close to heart
    SMOOTH MUSCLE: cells don't show cross-striations
General
    MYOBLAST: muscle cell precursors. Many myoblasts fuse to form a single muscle cell
Skeletal muscle
    MUSCLE FIBER: multi-nucleated muscle cell. Long, cylindrical
        SARCOLEMMA: cytoplasm of muscle cells
        SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM: endoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells. Stores Ca2+
        Nuclei immediately below the cell membrane
    MUSCLE FASCICLE: group of muscle fibers working together
    ENDOMYSIUM: thin layer of connective tissue surrounding individual fibers
        Contains reticular fibers and fibroblasts
    PERIMYSIUM: layer of connective tissue surrounding a fascicle
    EPIMYSIUM: layer of dense irregular connective tissue surrounding the entire muscle (collection of fascicles)
    MYOFIBRIL: each of the longitudinal subunits in a muscle fiber
        Z-lines in != myofibrils are not aligned with each other
    SARCOMERE: each functional unit of a myofibril. Myofibrils composed of several longitudinal sarcomeres
    Z-DISC/Z-LINE: dark band delimiting sarcomeres, perpendicular to myofibril axis. Many != proteins
    MYOFILAMENTS: protein filaments that make up the sarcomere
        THIN FILAMENTS: composed of actin and regulatory proteins. Anchored to the Z-line. 
        THICK FILAMENTS: composed of myosin II. Slide within thin filaments
    I-BAND: lighter band surrounding the Z-line. Isotropic. Contains thin filaments
    A-BAND: darker band between two I-bands. Anisotropic. Contains both thin and thick filaments
    H-BAND: slightly lighter band in the middle of an A band. Contains only thick filaments
    ACTOMYOSIN CROSS-BRIDGE CYCLE: mechanism of muscle contraction
        Thick filaments slide through thin filaments
        Ca2+ ions involved in regulation
    NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION: synapse site between neuron and muscle fiber. Controls voluntary movement





striated: stries perpendicular to fibers. Always cut along fibers
    cardiac: heart and veins
        shorter cells
        single nucleus
        intercalated discs: where cells attach. Single nucleus between each pair of intercalated discs
            adhering junctions: intercalating discs to muscle cells
            macula adherens: muscle cells to each other
            gap junctions
        involuntary: regulated by the autonomous nervous system
smooth: doesn't have them. Músculo invultario que rodea órganos
    slow, steady, involuntary contraction. E.g. stomach
    dense body: where filaments are attached. Aglomeration of proteins in the cell. Bound to the cytoskeleton
    thin attached to dense bodies, then thick in the middle
