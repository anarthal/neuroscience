not connective tissue
striated: stries perpendicular to fibers. Always cut along fibers
    skeletal: attached to bone
        formed by muscle fiber cells. Multi-nucleated, because they are formed by merging several myoblasts
        endomysium: connective tissue protecting one fiber. Rich in reticular fibers
        Fibers organized in fascicles
        Perymisium: connective tissue protecting a fascicle
        Epimysium: surrounds the entire muscle
        Each fiber is a cell
        Microfilaments
            Thick filaments: myosin
            Thin filaments: actin
        Z line: full of proteins
        Sarcomere: functional unit of muscle
        Sarcoplasmic reticulum: where the muscle stores Ca2+
        Actomyosin cross-bridge cycle: process that generates the contraction
        Neuromuscular junction: delivers the voluntary order to control the muscle
    visceral striated: morphologically identical, but not attached to a bone. E.g. tongue
    cardiac: heart and veins
        shorter cells
        single nucleus
        intercalated discs: where cells attach. Single nucleus between each pair of intercalated discs
            adhering junctions: intercalating discs to muscle cells
            macula adherens: muscle cells to each other
            gap junctions
        involuntary: regulated by the autonomous nervous system
smooth: doesn't have them. Músculo invultario que rodea órganos
    slow, steady, involuntary contraction. E.g. stomach
    dense body: where filaments are attached. Aglomeration of proteins in the cell. Bound to the cytoskeleton
    thin attached to dense bodies, then thick in the middle
