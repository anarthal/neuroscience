Background
    PROPRIOCEPTION: perception of self-position and force
Functional organization
    Central nervous system (CNS)
        Brain: cerebrum (telencéfalo), cerebellum, diencephalon, brain stem (tronco encefálico)
        Spinal cord
    Peripheral nervous system: everything outside the CNS
        Sensory division: conveys input towards the CNS
            Somatic senses: body-related (tact, thermal, pain, proprioception)
            Special senses: smell, taste, vision, hearing, equilibrium
        Motor division: conveys output from the CNS to the effectors
            Somatic nervous system: output to skeletal muscle. Voluntary
            Autonomic nervous system: output to glands, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Involuntary
                Sympathetic nervous system: promotes "flight or fight" responses (e.g. increase heart rate)
                Parasympathetic nervous system: promotes "rest and digest" responses (e.g. slower heart rate). Most effectors innervated by both
                Enteric nervous system: regulates smooth muscle and glands in gastrointestinal tract
Functions
    Sensory (input)
    Motor (output)
    Integrative (processing)
Protection
    Bone: cranial bones (brain), vertebrae (spinal cord)
    MENINGES: layers of connective tissue that protect the brain and spinal cord
        DURA MATER: thick, strong layer of dense irregular connective tissue. Continuous with epineurium
        ARACHNOID MATER: thin connective tissue layer. Avascular. Delicate collagen and elastic fibers
        PIA MATER: very thin connective tissue layer covering brain and spinal cord. Highly vascular
        DENTICULATE LIGAMENTS: extensions of pia mater into arachnoid mater suspending the spinal cord
        EPIDURAL SPACE: space between dura mater and bone (spinal cord only). Highly vascularized
        SUBDURAL SPACE: thin space between dura mater and arachnoid mater. Interstitial fluid
        SUBARACHNOID SPACE: space between arachnoid and pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid (cushioning)
====== (TODO) blood vessels
    internal carotid: frontal supply
    right vertebral: caudal, spinal cord, brain stem supply
blood-brain barrier: selective
    much more isolated than other organs (to prevent infections)
    drugs difficult to transport
    astrocyte endfeet: the end of the astrocytes that end in the capillaries
    permeable to lipid-soluble, water, gas, hormones
    non-permeable: water-soluble and toxins
    permeability can be altered under certain conditions
ventricular system
    contains cerebospinal fluid
    most waste is discarded by this fluid
    choroid plexus: where cerebrospinal fluid is formed
CSF
    protection
    waste removal
    transport
    signalling
    choroid plexus => lateral ventricles => 3rd ventricle => 4th ventricle => central canal of spinal cord => subarachnoid space => veins
    ependymal cells (glia): in the walls of ventricles
