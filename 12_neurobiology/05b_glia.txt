GLIA/NEUROGLIA (glue): non-conductive cells in the nervous system that support neurons
Smaller than neurons but more numerous
Can undergo mitosis
Synthesizes ECM: almost only ground substance (??)
ASTROCYTE (CNS): the most common type. Support neurons
    Metabolic support
    Astrocyte feet cover blood vessels => Blood-brain barrier
    Tripartite synapse: required for recovering and regenerating neurotransmitters
    Electric isolation
    Types
        Protoplasmic: ion homeostasis, metabolic support
        Fibrous: blood-brain barrier
    GLIAL SCAR: proliferation of astrocytes on neuronal damage
        Prevents damage and inflammation from spreading
        Too much can cause neurodegeneration
RADIAL GLIA (CNS): progenitors cells in the nervous system
    Differentiate into neurons and glial cells, except for microglia
    Scaffold for developing neurons
MICROGLIA (CNS): derived from monocytes, part of the immune system
    Defense, cleanup and remodelling of synapses
    May be resting (initial state), pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
OLIGODENDROCYTE (CNS): generates the myelin sheath
    One cell may myelinate several axons
EPENDYMAL CELL (CNS): epithelium-like cells that delimit cavities full of cerebrospinal fluid
    Single layer
    Produce cerebrospinal fluid
    Physical barrier
SCHWANN CELL (PNS): surround axons
    Produce myelin sheath (although they also cover non-myelinated axons)
    Regenerate axons after injury
    Doesn't have processes, just covers the axon => One cell myelinates a single axon
SATELLITE CELL (PNS): covers cell bodies in ganglia
    Electric isolation
    Metabolic support
ENTERIC GLIA (PNS): similar to astrocytes, but for enteric neurons (intestine)
MYELIN SHEATH: covers the axon
    Electrical isolation
    Increase signal conduction speed
    NODE OF RANVIER: relays between two consecutive myelinated axon segments
        Not covered by myelin
        SALTATORY CONDUCTION: perform relay of the signal. This increases signal conduction speed
    Mostly lipids, with some proteins => Does not stain
BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER: selective barrier that allows the passage of nutrients and ions, but not pathogens and other cells
