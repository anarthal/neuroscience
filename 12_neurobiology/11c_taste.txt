Primary tastes
    Salty: Na+
    Sour: H+ (acids)
    Sweet: glucose, fructose...
    Bitter: caffeine and similar
    Umami: amino-acids
TASTE BUD: oval body formed by epithelial cells capable of detecting flavors
    Taste receptor cells: the ones actually detecting flavors
        Surrounded by 1st order neuron dendrites
        Not neurons, but can generate action potentials
        Specific for one primary taste
        A single taste bud contains receptors for all primary tastes
    Supporting cells: have microvilli that come outside through the taste pore. Precursor of receptor cells
    Basal cells: stem cells in the base that can differentiate into supporting and receptor cells
    Taste pore: an opening in the epithelium where the taste bud is inserted
    Located in tongue, palate, pharynx, epiglottis
PAPILLAE: elevations in the tongue where taste buds are located
Saliva is required to solve tastants
    Production increased in rest-and-digest responses, decreased in fight-or-flight
Transduction: tastant activates receptors => depolarization => neurotransmitter release => action potential in 1st order neuron
    Ionotropic receptor cells: tastants enter directly through ion channels => depolarization. Salty and sour
    Metabotropic receptor cells: tastants bind to GPCR => 2nd messenger => Ca2+ release => depolarization. Rest
Pathway to the brain
    1st order: cranial nerve ganglia
    2nd order: medulla oblongata
    3rd order: thalamus/hypothalamus/limbic system
    Primary gustatory area
