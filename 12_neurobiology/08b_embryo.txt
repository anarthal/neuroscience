zygote: fusion of oocyte and sperm
morula: ball of cells
blastula: hollow structure
    trophoblast: outer layer
    embryoblast: inner
gastrula: 3 layers. When it implants into the 
    ectoderm
        neural plate => neural tube
        epidermis
        generates
            skin
            nervous system
            sensory organs (retina, inner ear...)
    mesoderm
        muscle
        blood vessels, blood
        kidney
        reproductive system
    endoderm
        digestive tract
        respiratory system
        extrectory system
    notochord: embryonic only (lost), for differentiation
cell types
    totipotent: can generate embryo cells and placenta
    pluripotent: can generate embryo cells
    multipotent: adult stem cells
neurulation: formation of the neural tube
    neural plate folds into neural groove
    closes and forms the tube and neural crest
    neural crests form somites => vertebrae, ribs, back muscles...
prosencephalon: cerebrum and encephalum
    telencephalon: cerebrum
    diencephalon: epithalamus, thalamus, hypothalamus
mesencephalon: midbrain
rhombencephalon
    metencephalon: pons, cerebellum
    myelencephalon
radial glia: progenitors of neurons and all glia except microglia
adult neurogenesis: only in certain areas (neurogenesis niches)
    subgranular zone (SGZ): memory and learning
    SVZ and
