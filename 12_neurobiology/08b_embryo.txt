NEURAL TUBE: tubular, longitudinal structure that forms in the embryo and develops into the nervous system
    NEURAL PLATE: ectoderm (in gastrula) thickens and forms this layer that will eventually close into the neural tube
        Located in the dorsal part
    NEURULATION: process where the neural plate closes into the neural tube
    NOTOCHORD: embryonic-only structure, ventral to neural tube, that aids in the process of neurulation
    NEURAL GROOVE: central thickening of the neural plate, formed during neurulation
    NEURAL FOLD: lateral parts of the neural plate that end up closing to form the neural tube
    NEURAL CREST: cells just above the just-formed neural tube. End up transitioning to mesenchymal cells and migrating
    SOMITE: structures below neural plate/tube, that will form vertebrae, ribs, back muscles...
    Cell layers (follow spinal cord's logic)
        Marginal layer (outer): yields the white matter
        Mantle layer (middle): yields the gray matter
        Central layer (inner): yields ependymal cells
    Develops due to opposed gradients of signals
        Bone morphogenetic protein: neural crest
        Sonic the hedgehog protein: notochord
Brain vesicles: neural tube develops into several vesicles that will form the adult CNS. Primary (3), develop into secondary (5)
    PROSENCEPHALON: the more rostral primary brain vesicle
        TELENCEPHALON: secondary brain vesicle that yields the cerebrum and lateral ventricles
        DIENCEPHALON (secondary vesicle): secondary brain vesicle that yields the adult diencephalon and 3rd ventricle
    MESENCEPHALON: middle primary and secondary brain vesicle that yields the midbrain
    RHOMBENCEPHALON: the more caudal primary brain vesicle
        METENCEPHALON: secondary brain vesicle that yields the pons and cerebellum. And 4th ventricle, with myelencephalon.
        MYELENCEPHALON: secondary brain vesicle that yields the brain stem
Neurogenesis in adults: olfactory bulb and hippocampus
