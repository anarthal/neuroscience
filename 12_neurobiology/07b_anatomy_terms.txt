nerve
    endo, peri, epi neurium => connective tissue surrounding
    axon, grouped in fascicles, grouped in nerves
    sensory => periphery to CNS
    motor nerve => CNS to muscle or other effectors
    mixed nerve => both
tract => like nerves, but without connective tissue. Bundle of axons
    Connect parts of the CNS
    covered by oligodendrocytes
    ascending: sensory info to CNS
    descending: CNS to effectors
ganglia: cluster of neuronal cell bodies in peripheral
nuclei: like ganglia, but in CNS
gray matter: cell bodies, dendrites, synapses
white matter: myelinated axons
decussation: crosses brain sides and moves vertically
commisure: same, but just horizontal
peduncle: white matter connecting != regions
cortex: outer layer of an organ
sagittal: left-right
    mid-sagittal: just in the middle
    para-sagittal: not in the middle
frontal: anterior/ventral - posterior/dorsal
transverse: upper/rostral-lower/caudal
planes rotate ~90ยบ around lateral axis in the brain
