NERVE: bundle of axons in the peripheral nervous system
    NERVE FIBER: each individual axon + Schwann cell sheath in a nerve
    NERVE FASCICLE: group of nerve fibers. A group of fascicles constitutes a nerve
    ENDONEURIUM: loose connective tissue surrounding individual nerve fibers (and "filling" fascicles)
    PERINEURIUM: connective tissue surrounding a nerve fascicle
    EPINEURIUM: connective tissue surrounding the entire nerve. Often associated with adipose tissue
    Types
        Sensory nerve: information from sensors to CNS
        Motor nerve: information from CNS to effectors
        Mixed nerve: combines both
TRACT: bundle of axons in the central nervous system
    Not encapsulated by connective tissue
    Types
        Ascending tract: information from sensors to CNS (e.g. spinal cord to thalamus)
        Descending tract: information from CNS to effectors (e.g. cortex to spinal cord)
LEMNISCUS: thin, planar tract
GANGLION: cluster of cell bodies in the PNS
NUCLEUS: cluster of cell bodies in the CNS
GRAY MATTER: part of the CNS containing cell bodies, dendrites and synapses
WHITE MATTER: part of the CNS containing myelinated axons
NEUROPIL: substance between some in gray matter
FORAMEN: hole for the passage of nerves or blood vessels (e.g. intervertebral foramen)
DECUSSATION: oblique crossing of axons (crosses from left to right and vice versa)
CORTEX: outer layer of an organ
Anatomical planes
    SAGITTAL PLANE: vertical plane that divides body and brain in left and right
        MID-SAGITTAL PLANE: sagittal plane located in the symmetry axis
        PARA-SAGITTAL PLANE: sagittal plane performing unequal divisions of the body (not along the symmetry axis)
        Medial: something located close to the mid-sagittal plane. Vs. lateral
    CORONAL PLANE/FRONTAL PLANE: vertical plane perpendicular to sagittal plane
        Divides body in anterior (face) and posterior (back) parts
    TRANSVERSE PLANE/AXIAL PLANE: horizontal plane, perpendicular to sagittal and coronal
        Divides body in superior (upper) and inferior (lower)
    LONGITUDINAL AXIS: axis traversing CNS, from the inferior part of the spinal cord to the forebrain
        Vertical in the spinal cord, then axial to the brain stem, then 30ยบ upper from the horizontal
        Referencing the plane containing the longitudinal axis and the left-right axis
            Dorsal: on the upper part (brain) or the posterior part (spinal cord)
            Ventral: on the lower part (brain) or the anterior part (spinal cord)
        Referencing the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis
            Rostral: on the part closer to the forebrain (brain) or the superior part (spinal cord)
            Caudal: on the part further from the forebrain (brain) or the inferior part (spinal cord)
