all are Ca2+ mediated
excitatory neurotransmitter: leads to depolarization of post-synaptic element (i.e. closer to generating action potential)
    e.g. glutamate, allows Na+ to enter
    excitatory postsynaptic potential
inhibitory neurotransmitter: the opposite. E.g. GABA lets Cl- to enter
a neuron can secrete != neurotransmitters, even at once, but not in the same vesicle
metabotropic receptors slower than ligand-gated (ionotrpic)
    glutamate and GABA linked to faster responses
    biogenic amines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine) linked to slower responses
Glutamate
    recycled by astrocytes
    Converted to glutamine in astrocytes (glutamine synthase)
    then returned to the neuron, and converted to glutamate again
    there are no transporters for glutamate
    can also be obtained from Krebs cycle, and used as an input to Krebs cycle
GABA
    synthesized from glutamate in neurons
    captured by astrocytes, enters the Krebs cycle, converted to glutamate, then to glutamine => same path as glutamate
    glutamate decarboxylase (synthesizing GABA from glutamate) expressed only in inhibitory neurons
acetylcholine
    small molecule
    muscle contraction
    from acetyl CoA (Krebs) and choline
    no astrocytes here, degraded directly in the synaptic cleft by an enzyme
noradrenaline
    synthesized from dopamine
dopamine: feel good
serotonin: mood, sleep, happiness
    from tryptophan
receptors
    ionotropic: ligand-gated ion channels. Fast, short-lived
    metabotropic: G-protein coupled. Affect metabolism. Slow, long-lived
    don't need to know the names of glutamate receptors 
    benzodiazepins stimulate GABA receptors
    metabotropic => signaling cascade that ends up activating kinases => phosphorylation of other proteins
