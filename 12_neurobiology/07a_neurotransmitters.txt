A neurotransmitter might be excitatory or inhibitory depending on the receptor in the postsynaptic element
A presynaptic element can secrete != neurotransmitters at once
REUPTAKE: absorption of neurotransmitter by axon/glia after synapse has taken place, for degradation or recycling
    NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTER: membrane proteins that perform the reuptake
Receptors
    IONOTROPIC RECEPTOR: ligand-gated ion channels (neurotransmitter is the ligand)
        Produce fast, short-lived responses
    METABOTROPIC RECEPTOR: G-protein receptors that modulate ion channels via signalling cascade
        Slower, longer-lived responses (affect metabolism)
Types
    Amino acids: glutamate, GABA
    Small molecules: acetylcholine
    Biogenic amines: adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin
        Act through metabotropic receptors
Glutamate: the main excitatory neurotransmitter
    Learning, plasticity
    Tends to opens Na+, Ca2+ channels => depolarization
    Glutamate-glutamine cycle: astrocyte reuptakes glutamate and recycles it
        1. Glutamate transporters in astrocytes reuptakes glutamate
        2. Glutamine synthase in astrocyte converts glutamate to glutamine
        3. Glutamine transferred to neuron
        4. Glutaminase converts glutamine to glutamate
        5. Glutamine packed in synaptic vesicles
    Glutamate can be synthesized/degraded in the neuron using alpha-ketogluturate (Krebs cycle intermediate) 
    EXCITOTOXICITY: damage to neurons because of too much glutamate excitation
GAMMA-AMINOBUTIRIC ACID (GABA): the main inhibitory neurotransmitter
    Relaxation (diazepam promotes the effects of GABA)
    Tends to open Cl- channels => hyperpolarization
    Synthesized from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase
Acetylcholine
    Somatic nervous system: muscle contraction
    Parasympathetic system (e.g. diminishes heart rate)
    Synthesized from CoA (Krebs cycle intermediate) and choline
    Degraded by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft (no astrocytes)
Noradrenaline/norepinephrine and adrenaline/epinephrine
    Sympathetic system: prepares body for stress
    Acts as neurotransmitter and as hormone
    Synthesized from dopamine
Dopamine
    Controls voluntary movements
    Reward circuit: makes us feel good
Serotonin
    Enteric system
    Regulates mood, sleep, appetite, emotions
    Synthesized from tryptophan
