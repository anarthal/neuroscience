ECM: lymph (fluid)
Cell population
    Lymphocytes
    Supporting cells: other leukocytes (e.g. antigen presentation), reticular cells
Organization
    LYMPHATIC VESSEL: tubule conducting lymph
    DIFFUSE LYMPHATIC TISSUE/MUCOSE-ASSOCIATED LYMPHATIC TISSUE (MALT): non-encapsulated lymphatic tissue under epithelium of some systems
        Guard usual pathogen entry paths: digestive, respiratory, genito-urinary tract
    LYMPHATIC NODULES: non-encapsulated accumulation of lymphocytes
        Random locations, except for gastrointestinal tract (e.g. tonsils)
        Forms when an antigen is recognized and lymphocytes proliferate
        Primary nodule: accumulation of small lymphocytes
        Secondary nodule: accumulation of lymphocytes with two separate areas
            Germinal center: in the middle. Surrounding point where B lymphocyte recognized antigen. Clonal activity of B lymphocytes
            Corona: naive B lymphocytes
    LYMPHATIC NODE: filter lymph, eliminating antigens
    LYMPHATIC ORGANS: organs directly associated with the immune system
        Thymus: development of T lymphocytes. Central tolerance
        Spleen: filters blood
