HYPOTHALAMUS: structure in diencephalon anterior and inferior to thalamus
    Regulates ANS and hormone production
    Senses changes in temperature, glucose, osmolarity, melatonin... and acts in consequence
    Regulates appetite and sleep
HYPOPHYSIS/PITUITARY GLAND: anterior to hypothalamus. Produces hormones and regulates the rest of the endocrine system
    Regulated by hypothalamus and by negative feedback on the hormones it produces
    INFUNDIBULUM: link between hypothalamus and hypophysis
    ADENOHYPOPHYSIS: anterior lobe of hypophysis, producing hormones. This is not nerve tissue
    NEUROHYPOPHYSIS: contains neurons that directly secrete hormones into the blood through their axon
    HYPOPHYSEAL PORTAL SYSTEM: network of capillaries connecting hypothalamus with adenohypophysis
        Hypothalamus releases local signal molecules to the portal system => Regulate adenohypophysis
