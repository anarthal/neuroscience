Background
    SENSATION: acquisition of information by our senses
    PERCEPTION: process of interpreting sensory information by our brain
    1ST ORDER NEURON: in senses, the 1st neuron that generates an action potential when the sense is activated
    NTH ORDER NEURON: in senses, the n-th neuron that generates an action potential in signal's pathway from the sensory system to the brain
OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM: where receptors for olfaction are located
    CRIBIFORM PLATE: bone surface in the nasal cavity on top of which the olfactory epithelium is located
    Mucosa: has lamina propria below epithelium and is covered by mucus
    Mucus: keep epithelium humid to capture odorants
    Cell types
        Olfactory sensory neuron: bipolar neurons with cilia in their apical part (on top of dendrites) that capture odorants
        Supporting cells: epithelial cells. Metabolic support, structural support, electrical isolation
        Basal cells: stem cells that may differentiate into new olfactory sensory neurons
    BOWMAN'S GLAND/OLFACTORY GLAND: produce mucus for the olfactory epithelium
OLFACTORY BULB: structure in the cerebrum that contains the 2nd order neurons for smell
    Located frontal and inferior to the prefrontal cortex
    Receives input from 1st order neurons via the olfactory nerve
    MITRAL CELL: neurons in the olfactory bulb
    GLOMERULI: place of synapse between olfactory sensory neurons and mitral cells in the olfactory bulb
    Many sensory neurons synapse with 1 mitral cell. One sensory neuron synapses with one mitral cell
ODORANT: chemical compound that can be detected by the smell
    We detect odours as a particular combination of odorants
    Many different odorants => almost infinite number of possible odours (vs. taste)
Transduction: odorant activates GPCR => cAMP production => Na+/Ca2+ channel opens => action potential
Pathway to the brain
    1st order: olfactory sensory neuron
    2nd order: mitral cells
    3rd order: thalamus/amygdala/hippocampus
    Primary olfactory area
    Orbitofrontal cortex: odour discrimination
