behind the pons
connected to it through the 3 peduncles
most of connections through the middle one
densely packed with neurons
2 hemispheres separated by cerebellar vermis
arbor vitae: white matter
vestibulocerebellum: inner ear, equilibrium
spinocerebellum: spinal cord, receives info from muscles
cerebrocerebellum: thalamus, motor cortex. Planning of complex movements
only output is deep cerebellar nuclei (subcateogories not reqd)
    other cells, e.g. purkinje cells, go through these
cerebellar cortex has always the same complexity
    molecular layer: mainly dendrites, some interneurons and some axons. Where synapses are established
    purkinje cell layer: somas
    granular layer: many granule cells
Purkinje cell
    Inhibitory connections to the deep cerebellar nuclei
    (deep cerebellar nuclei are excitatory)
    E.g. if a movement fails, inhibits deep cerebellar nuclei cells not to repeat the movement
granular cells: connected to purkinje cells. excitatory
    parallel fibers: axons of granular cells
    climbing fibers: axons from elsewhere, one per purkinje cell
cerebellum affected by alcohol
ataxia: impaired coordination and movement
