CEREBELLUM: posterior to pons. Motor adjustment and learning, equilibrium
    Most of the neurons in the brain are here
External anatomy
    Anterior lobe: anterior, upper part
    Posterior lobe: posterior, lower part
    Flocculonodular lobe: small, cylindrical lobe below posterior lobe, next to pons
    Primary fissure: separates anterior and posterior lobes. In the superior surface
    Vermis: separates the cerebellar hemispheres
    CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLES: connect cerebellum with the rest of the CNS
        Superior: to midbrain
        Middle: to pons. Most of the connections happen here
        Inferior: to medulla oblongata
Functional divisions
    Vestibulocerebellum: flocculonodular lobe. Info from vestibular system
    Spinocerebellum: vermis and central parts of anterior/posterior lobes. Info <=> spinal cord
    Cerebrocerebellum: rest of anterior/posterior lobes. Info <=> thalamus, cerebral cortex. Motor planning
Histological components
    CEREBELLAR FOLIA: each of the leaf-shaped ridges in the cerebellar surface (singular folium). Covered by meninges
        CEREBELLAR CORTEX: gray matter portion of each folium. Has always the same complexity (vs. cerebral cortex)
            Molecular layer: 
        ARBOR VITAE: white matter portion of each folium
    DEEP CEREBELLAR NUCLEI: nuclei in the center of the cerebellum
        Neurons use glutamate
        The only cerebellum output

cerebellar cortex has always the same complexity
    molecular layer: mainly dendrites, some interneurons and some axons. Where synapses are established
    purkinje cell layer: somas
    granular layer: many granule cells
Purkinje cell
    Inhibitory connections to the deep cerebellar nuclei
    (deep cerebellar nuclei are excitatory)
    E.g. if a movement fails, inhibits deep cerebellar nuclei cells not to repeat the movement
granular cells: connected to purkinje cells. excitatory
    parallel fibers: axons of granular cells
    climbing fibers: axons from elsewhere, one per purkinje cell
cerebellum affected by alcohol
ataxia: impaired coordination and movement
