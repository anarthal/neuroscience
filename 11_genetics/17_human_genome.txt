General mechanisms are shared. You find the difference between species in the small details
C value: number of mega bases
Composition
    Protein-coding genes
    Regulatory sequences
    Sequences coding for non-coding RNAs: rRNA, tRNA, siRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA...
    Tandem repeats: satellites, mini-satellites, micro-satellites. Telomeres and centromeres
    Interspersed repeats: transposable elements
JUNK DNA: non-functional DNA, with unknown biological function. Depends on the field of study and open to interpretation
Very similar to apes. Small != in some genes, copy number, some deletions...
