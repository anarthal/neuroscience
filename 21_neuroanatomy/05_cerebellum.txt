Peduncles
    Inferior (to medulla)
        TBC: composed by restiform and juxtarestiform bodies
    BRACHIUM PONTIS: middle peduncle (to pons)
    BRACHIUM CONJUNCTIVUM: superior peduncle (to midbrain)
SPINOCEREBELLAR TRACT: proprioceptive information from trunk and lower limbs to the cerebellum
    Dorsal: ipsilateral, mainly from thoracic segments
        Posterior root ganglia
        Synapse in Clarke nucleus
            CLARKE NUCLEUS/POSTERIOR THORACIC NUCLEUS: nucleus in the gray horn where 2nd order neurons for this tract are
        Ascend through dorsal spinocerebellar tract
        Enter cerebellum through inferior cerebellar peduncle
    Ventral: double cross, mainly from lumbar segments
        Posterior root ganglia
        Synapse in spinal border cells
        Decussate through anterior white commissure
        Ascend through ventral spinocerebellar tract
        Enter cerebellum through superior cerebellar peduncle
        Recross again
CUNEOCEREBELLAR TRACT: proprioceptive information from upper trunk and upper limbs to the cerebellum. Ipsilateral
    Ascend the spinal cord through cuneate fasciculus until medulla oblongata
    Synapse in accessory cuneate nucleus
        ACCESSORY CUNEATE NUCLEUS: nucleus in medulla oblongata, lateral to the main cuneate nucleus, relaying info to the cerebellum
    Fibers enter the cerebellum through the inferior peduncle
