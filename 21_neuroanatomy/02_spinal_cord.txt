Functional components: indicates the function of spinal nerve/cranial nerve fibers and neurons. Special components only in cranial nerves
    GENERAL SOMATIC AFFERENT (GSA): sensory, innervating the body wall (e.g. skin)
    GENERAL VISCERAL AFFERENT (GVA): sensory, innervating visceral structures (e.g. cardiac muscle)
    GENERAL SOMATIC EFFERENT (GSE): motor, innervating skeletal muscle
    GENERAL VISCERAL EFFERENT (GVE): motor, innervating cardiac/smooth muscle and glands
    SPECIAL SOMATIC AFFERENT (SSA): sensory, for special senses (e.g. optic nerve)
    SPECIAL VISCERAL AFFERENT (SVA): sensory, for taste
    SPECIAL VISCERAL EFFERENT (SVE): motor, innervating smooth muscle derived from branchial arches (e.g. mastication)
    Note: special somatic efferent does not exist
MYOTOME: group of muscles innervated by the same spinal/cranial nerve
PROPRIOSPINAL FIBERS: connect different parts of the spinal cord, for reflexes
REXED'S LAMINA: each of the subdivisions of the gray matter in the spinal cord, based on cytoarchitecture
