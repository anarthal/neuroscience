Sympathetic system
    Preganglionic neurons in intermediolateral column (lateral gray horn). Use ACh
    Postganglionic neurons in paravertebral or prevertebral chains. Use NA
    PARAVERTEBRAL GANGLIA: ganglion chain, outside the spinal chord, containing sympathetic motor neurons
    PREVERTEBRAL GANGLIA: ganglia slightly further away from the spinal chord, containing sympathetic motor neurons
    RAMUS COMMUNICANTES: joins spinal nerve and paravertebral ganglion chain
        Gray: no myelin. Postganglionic fibers
        White: myelinated. Preganglionic fibers
Parasympathetic system
    Preganglionic neurons in brainstem and sacral segments of spinal cord. Use ACh
    Postganglionic neurons in ganglia next to the organs it innervates. Use ACh
    E.g. ciliary ganglion for pupil dilation
TBC: move this
    Cortex layer III and IV: communication within cortex areas
    Cortex layer IV: more prominent in sensory cortices
    Cortex layer V: main output of the cortex to lower areas. Where motor pathways start
POSTERIOR COLUMN MEDIAL LEMNISCAL SYSTEM: proprioception, tactile, vibratory info to CNS
    Heavily myelinated fibers
    Somatotopic organization: lower dermatomes => more medial
    Spinal cord: fibers travel in the posterior column
        POSTERIOR FUNICULI: other name for posterior column
        Sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia
        Some axons synapse in the gray matter (reflexes), the rest ascend forming the posterior column
        GRACILE FASCICULUS: the more medial one
        CUNEATE FASCICULUS: the more lateral one
    Synapse in medulla oblongata in gracile and cuneate nuclei
    INTERNAL ARCUATE FIBERS: first part of the axons of the neurons in gracile/cuneate nuclei, forming a decussation. End in medial lemniscus
    SENSORY DECUSSATION: decussation at medulla level, formed by internal arcuate fibers
    Ascends through medial lemniscus through all the brain stem until thalamus
    Synapses in ventral posterior lateral (VPL) in thalamus
    Then, to primary somatosensory cortex
    Implements lateral inhibition to provide more precise information => Two-point discrimination
ANTEROLATERAL SYSTEM: pain, temperature, crude touch (no position) info to CNS
    Slower, less localized than posterior column medial lemniscus
    Somatotopic organization: lower dermatomes => more lateral
    Spinal cord: fibers travel in the anterior/lateral columns
        Sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia
        Some axons descend a couple levels => interneurons => reflexes
        Some axons ascend a couple of levels, then synapse in posterior horn
            SUBSTANTIA GELATINOSA: Rexed's lamina II, in posterior gray horn, where interneurons for ALS are
        LISSAUER'S COLUMN/POSTEROLATERAL TRACT: bundle of axons in ALS between entering the dorsal root and the synapse in the posterior horn
        After synapsing, axons decussate through the anterior white commissure
        Then, axons ascend through the anterior/lateral columns
    NEOSPINOTHALAMIC TRACT: goes directly from spinal cord to VPL in thalamus
        Quicker, more localized
        From thalamus to primary somatosensory cortex
    PALEOSPINOTHALAMIC TRACT: multi-synaptic, through reticular formation
        Slower, more diffuse
        From thalamus to cortices of limbic system
    Has also fibers ending in reticular formation, midbrain, tectum
CORTICOSPINAL TRACT: main somatic motor pathway
    Somatotopic
    Starts in pyramidal cells in layer V of the cortex
    Descends directly through cerebral peduncles
    85% decussates in the pyramids, descends through lateral corticospinal tract (medial to spinocerebellar tract)
    15% does not decussate, descends through the anterior corticospinal tract
    Synapses in motor neuron in ventral horn
RUBROSPINAL TRACT: control of distal flexors in upper limb (e.g. flexing fingers)
    From red nucleus
    Decussates in midbrain
    Descends through rubrospinal tract, lateral to corticospinal tract, next to lateral gray horn

TECTOSPINAL TRACT: head movements
    From superior colliculus
    In medial longitudinal fasciculus
