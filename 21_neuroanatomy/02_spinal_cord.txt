Functional components: indicates the function of spinal nerve/cranial nerve fibers and neurons. Special components only in cranial nerves
    GENERAL SOMATIC AFFERENT (GSA): sensory, innervating the body wall (e.g. skin)
    GENERAL VISCERAL AFFERENT (GVA): sensory, innervating visceral structures (e.g. cardiac muscle)
    GENERAL SOMATIC EFFERENT (GSE): motor, innervating skeletal muscle
    GENERAL VISCERAL EFFERENT (GVE): motor, innervating cardiac/smooth muscle and glands
    SPECIAL SOMATIC AFFERENT (SSA): sensory, for special senses (e.g. optic nerve)
    SPECIAL VISCERAL AFFERENT (SVA): sensory, for taste
    SPECIAL VISCERAL EFFERENT (SVE): motor, innervating smooth muscle derived from branchial arches (e.g. mastication)
    Note: special somatic efferent does not exist
MYOTOME: group of muscles innervated by the same spinal/cranial nerve
PROPRIOSPINAL FIBERS: connect different parts of the spinal cord, for reflexes
REXED'S LAMINA: each of the subdivisions of the gray matter in the spinal cord, based on cytoarchitecture
Sympathetic system
    Ganglia next to the spinal cord
    PARAVERTEBRAL GANGLIA: ganglion chain, outside the spinal chord, containing sympathetic motor neurons
    PREVERTEBRAL GANGLIA: ganglia slightly further away from the spinal chord, containing sympathetic motor neurons
    RAMUS COMMUNICANTES: joins spinal nerve and paravertebral ganglion chain
        Gray: no myelin. Postganglionic fibers
        White: myelinated. Preganglionic fibers
    Preganglionic neurons in intermediolateral column (lateral gray horn). Use ACh
    Postganglionic neurons in paravertebral or prevertebral chains. Use NA
Parasympathetic system: ganglia next to the organs it innervates. Use ACh
TBC: move this
    Cortex layer III and IV: communication within cortex areas
    Cortex layer IV: more prominent in sensory cortices
    Cortex layer V: main output of the cortex to lower areas. Where motor pathways start
CORTICOSPINAL TRACT: main somatic motor pathway
    Somatotopic
    Starts in pyramidal cells in layer V of the cortex
    Descends directly through cerebral peduncles
    85% decussates in the pyramids, descends through lateral corticospinal tract (medial to spinocerebellar tract)
    15% does not decussate, descends through the anterior corticospinal tract
    Synapses in motor neuron in ventral horn
RUBROSPINAL TRACT: control of distal flexors in upper limb (e.g. flexing fingers)
    From red nucleus
    Decussates in midbrain
    Descends through rubrospinal tract, lateral to corticospinal tract, next to lateral gray horn
    Synapses in motor neuron in ventral horn
MEDIAL LONGITUDINAL FASCICULUS: fascicle closer to the anterior while commissure
TECTOSPINAL TRACT: head movements
    From superior colliculus
    In medial longitudinal fasciculus
VESTIBULOSPINAL TRACT: reflex response to equilibrium information, to maintain posture
    From vestibular nuclei
    Medial: in medial longitudinal fasciculus. Bilateral. Head and neck
    Lateral: lateral to anterior corticospinal tract. Contralateral. Rest of the body
RETICULOSPINAL TRACT: from reticular formation, for posture and muscle tone
    Surrounds lateral gray horn
SPINOCEREBELLAR TRACT: proprioceptive information from trunk and lower limbs to the cerebellum
    Dorsal: ipsilateral, mainly from thoracic segments
        Posterior root ganglia
        Synapse in Clarke nucleus
            CLARKE NUCLEUS/POSTERIOR THORACIC NUCLEUS: nucleus in the gray horn where 2nd order neurons for this tract are
        Ascend through dorsal spinocerebellar tract
        Enter cerebellum through inferior cerebellar peduncle
    Ventral: double cross, mainly from lumbar segments
        Posterior root ganglia
        Synapse in spinal border cells
        Decussate through anterior white commissure
        Ascend through ventral spinocerebellar tract
        Enter cerebellum through superior cerebellar peduncle
        Recross again
CUNEOCEREBELLAR TRACT: proprioceptive information from upper trunk and upper limbs to the cerebellum. Ipsilateral
    Ascend the spinal cord through cuneate fasciculus until medulla oblongata
    Synapse in accessory cuneate nucleus
        ACCESSORY CUNEATE NUCLEUS: nucleus in medulla oblongata, lateral to the main cuneate nucleus, relaying info to the cerebellum
    Fibers enter the cerebellum through the inferior peduncle
