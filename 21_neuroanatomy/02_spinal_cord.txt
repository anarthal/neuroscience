Functional components: indicates the function of spinal nerve/cranial nerve fibers and neurons. Special components only in cranial nerves
    GENERAL SOMATIC AFFERENT (GSA): sensory, innervating the body wall (e.g. skin)
    GENERAL VISCERAL AFFERENT (GVA): sensory, innervating visceral structures (e.g. cardiac muscle)
    GENERAL SOMATIC EFFERENT (GSE): motor, innervating skeletal muscle
    GENERAL VISCERAL EFFERENT (GVE): motor, innervating cardiac/smooth muscle and glands
    SPECIAL SOMATIC AFFERENT (SSA): sensory, for special senses (e.g. optic nerve)
    SPECIAL VISCERAL AFFERENT (SVA): sensory, for taste
    SPECIAL VISCERAL EFFERENT (SVE): motor, innervating smooth muscle derived from branchial arches (e.g. mastication)
    Note: special somatic efferent does not exist
MYOTOME: group of muscles innervated by the same spinal/cranial nerve
PROPRIOSPINAL FIBERS: connect different parts of the spinal cord, for reflexes
REXED'S LAMINA: each of the subdivisions of the gray matter in the spinal cord, based on cytoarchitecture
Sympathetic system
    Ganglia next to the spinal cord
    PARAVERTEBRAL GANGLIA: ganglion chain, outside the spinal chord, containing sympathetic motor neurons
    PREVERTEBRAL GANGLIA: ganglia slightly further away from the spinal chord, containing sympathetic motor neurons
    RAMUS COMMUNICANTES: joins spinal nerve and paravertebral ganglion chain
        Gray: no myelin. Postganglionic fibers
        White: myelinated. Preganglionic fibers
    Preganglionic neurons in intermediolateral column (lateral gray horn). Use ACh
    Postganglionic neurons in paravertebral or prevertebral chains. Use NA
Parasympathetic system: ganglia next to the organs it innervates. Use ACh
TBC: move this
    Cortex layer III and IV: communication within cortex areas
    Cortex layer IV: more prominent in sensory cortices
    Cortex layer V: main output of the cortex to lower areas. Where motor pathways start
CORTICOSPINAL TRACT: main somatic motor pathway
    Somatotopic
    Starts in pyramidal cells in layer V of the cortex
    Descends directly through cerebral peduncles
    85% decussates in the pyramids, descends through lateral corticospinal tract (medial to spinocerebellar tract)
    15% does not decussate, descends through the anterior corticospinal tract
    Synapses in motor neuron in ventral horn
RUBROSPINAL: from red nucleus
    Decussates in midbrain
    Descends through rubrospinal tract, lateral to corticospinal tract
    Synapses in motor neuron in ventral horn
