Somatosensory modalities
    Proprioception
    Touch
    Temperature
    Nociception: pain
Each receptor (e.g. golgi tendon organ vs. muscle spindles) associated to different types of nerve fiber (e.g. A-alpha, A-beta)
Trigemino-thalamic system: like dorsal column-medial lemniscus, but for face somatosensory info
    Ventral posterior medial receives this info in the thalamus
    Contains large multipolar cells that project to cortex (talamocortical cells). Excitatory, glutamate
    Also inhibitory cells that receive input from cortex
RECEPTOR FIELD: area of the skin covered by a single receptor
Primary somatosensory cortex: posterior to central sulcus
    The more receptor density, the wider the area in the somatosensory cortex
Secondary somatosensory cortex: posterior to primary, higher order processing
ALLODYNIA: some stimuli are felt like pain when they shouldn't
HYPERALGESIA: increased sensitivity to pain
NEUROPATHIC PAIN: feeling pain without any stimuli, usually because nerve endings were damaged (e.g. phantom limb in amputated limb)
Parvocellular: has small cells. vs. magnocellular
Enthorhinal cortex: transition between
