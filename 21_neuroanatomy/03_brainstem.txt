NUCLEUS AMBIGUUS: nucleus in medulla oblongata. Muscles in palate, pharynx, larynx, and some parasympathetic
DORSAL (MOTOR) NUCLEUS OF THE VAGUS: in medulla oblongata. Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons for many organs
SALIVATORY NUCLEI: parasympathetic innervation of salivary glands, in the pons. Superior and inferior
Olive: set of nuclei in medulla oblongata/pons
    INFERIOR OLIVE: performs integration of somatosensory information from spinal cord, motor commands and other inputs, and projects to cerebellum
    SUPERIOR OLIVE: related to hearing
PONTINE NUCLEI: receive input from motor-related cerebral cortices (i.e. what's the current plan?) and other inputs. Integrates them and projects to cerebellum
