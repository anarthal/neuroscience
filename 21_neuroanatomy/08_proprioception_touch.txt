POSTERIOR COLUMN MEDIAL LEMNISCAL SYSTEM: proprioception, tactile, vibratory info to CNS
    Heavily myelinated fibers
    Somatotopic organization: lower dermatomes => more medial
    Spinal cord: fibers travel in the posterior column
        POSTERIOR FUNICULI: other name for posterior column
        Sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia
        Some axons synapse in the gray matter (reflexes), the rest ascend forming the posterior column
        GRACILE FASCICULUS: the more medial one
        CUNEATE FASCICULUS: the more lateral one
    Synapse in medulla oblongata in gracile and cuneate nuclei
    INTERNAL ARCUATE FIBERS: first part of the axons of the neurons in gracile/cuneate nuclei, forming a decussation. End in medial lemniscus
    SENSORY DECUSSATION: decussation at medulla level, formed by internal arcuate fibers
    Ascends through medial lemniscus through all the brain stem until thalamus
    Synapses in ventral posterior lateral (VPL) in thalamus
    TBC: where does it go from here?
    Implements lateral inhibition to provide more precise information => Two-point discrimination
ANTEROLATERAL SYSTEM: pain, temperature, crude touch (no position) info to CNS
    Slower, less localized than posterior column medial lemniscus
    Somatotopic organization: lower dermatomes => more lateral
    Spinal cord: fibers travel in the anterior/lateral columns
        Sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia
        Some axons descend a couple levels => interneurons => reflexes
        Some axons ascend a couple of levels, then synapse in posterior horn
        LISSAUER'S COLUMN/POSTEROLATERAL TRACT: bundle of axons in ALS between entering the dorsal root and the synapse in the posterior horn
        After synapsing, axons decussate through the anterior white commissure
        Then, axons ascend through the anterior/lateral columns
    NEOSPINOTHALAMIC TRACT: goes directly from spinal cord to VPL in thalamus
        Quicker, more localized
        From thalamus to primary somatosensory cortex
    PALEOSPINOTHALAMIC TRACT: multi-synaptic, through reticular formation
        Slower, more diffuse
        From thalamus to cortices of limbic system
    Has also fibers ending in reticular formation, midbrain, tectum
