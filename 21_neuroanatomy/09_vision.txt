STRIATE CORTEX/V1: primary visual cortex
Processing levels
    Inferior: low-level features (e.g. color, contrast). In retina
    Intermediate: objects. In lateral geniculate nucleus and V1
    Superior: further processing. In V2-V5
Eyeball anatomy
    FIBROUS TUNICA: outer, protective layer of the eyeball
        SCLERA: outer, white cover of dense connective tissue
        CORNEA: transparent layer that covers the lens. Continuous with sclera
        LIMBUS: transition zone between cornea and sclera
        CONJUNCTIVA: epithelial tissue extending from the lateral part of the cornea, covering the sclera
    VASCULAR TUNICA/UVEA: intermediate layer of the eyeball
        CHOROID: vascular layer beneath sclera that provides nutrients
        PUPIL: hollow part anterior to lens that lets light in. Adjustable in size
        IRIS: extension of choroid that adjusts pupil's size. Responsible for eye color
        CILIARY BODY: tissue behind iris containing ciliary muscle
        CILIARY MUSCLE: changes the lens' shape, to accommodate vision at != distances
        Pupillary sphincter muscle: embedded in the iris. Makes the pupil smaller
        Pupillary dilator muscle: embedded in the iris. Makes the pupil bigger
    RETINA: inner layer of the eyeball, where images are formed
        PIGMENTED RETINA: melanin-rich, inner layer of retina
            Absorbs excess light
            Protects, nourishes and renews photoreceptors
            Why we see the pupil black
        NEURAL RETINA: signal transduction
            Photoreceptor layer: contains cells that absorb light
            Outer synaptic/plexiform layer: synapses between photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Contains horizontal cells
            Bipolar layer: 1st order neurons
            Inner synaptic/plexiform layer: synapses between bipolar and ganglion cells. Contains amacrine cells
            Ganglion layer: 2nd order neurons
        EYE DISC: point in the eyeball where optic nerve exits. Blind spot
        MACULA LUTEA: portion of the retina directly opposed to pupil
        FOVEA CENTRALIS: center of macula lutea. Has no rods, bipolar or ganglion cells => High-resolution color vision
    Lens: converging, to focus images in the retina. Inverts and reverses the image
    ANTERIOR CHAMBER: between cornea and lens, filled with aqueous humor
    VITREOUS CHAMBER: between lens and retina, filled with vitreous humor
Retinal processing: information trimmed (99% filtered before reaching optic nerve)
    Receptive field of a cell: region of the retina that triggers a response in the cell when illuminated
    ON bipolar/ganglion cell: fires more rapidly when illuminated. Vs. OFF cell. Having both decreases response time
    Retina specially sensitive to image edges and temporal changes in image
    Horizontal cell: perform horizontal inhibition to sharpen images
    Amacrine cells: comparisons to make ganglion cells more sensitive to moving stimuli
    Ganglion cells
        Magnocellular: big receptive field. High temporal resolution. To magnocellular layers of LGN
        Parvocellular: small receptive field. High spatial resolution. To parvocellular layers of LGN
        Koniocellular: intermediate. To intercalated layers of LGN
        Others regulate circadian rhythms (hypothalamus)
MIOSIS: reduction of pupil diameter using the sphincter muscles
    Parasympathetic
    Edinger-westphal (ACh) => ciliary ganglion (NE) => sphincter muscle
MYDRIASIS: increase of pupil diameter using dilator muscles
    Sympathetic
    Hypothalamus => lateral gray horn in spinal cord (ACh) => superior cervical ganglion (NE) => dilator muscle
PUPILLARY LIGHT REFLEX: opening/closing the pupil when lighting conditions change
