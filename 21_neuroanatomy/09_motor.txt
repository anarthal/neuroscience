Corticospinal tract is composed by axons in several cortices (and not just MI) => Movement involves parallel processing
    Primary motor cortex (MI): involved in activating individual muscles. Brodmann area 4
    SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR CORTEX: planning sequence of movements. Stimulation can cause activation of several muscles. Brodmann area 6
    Premotor cortex: preparation to move. Controls proximal muscles to orient the body to prepare it for movement. Brodmann area 6
    Every cortex has somatotopic organization (one body map per cortex)
CORTICONUCLEAR PATHWAY/CORTICOBULBAR PATHWAY: from motor cortices to cranial nerve nuclei in brain stem
SUBSTANTIA INNOMINATA: set of nuclei and white matter in the basal forebrain, below anterior thalamus. Part of basal nuclei
Basal nuclei
    Dorsal basal nuclei
        Neostriatum: caudate nucleus + putamen
        Paleostriatum: globus pallidus
            Globus pallidus medial/internal
            Globus pallidus lateral/external
            Medullary lamina: separates medial and lateral parts
    Ventral striatum: nucleus accumbens + olfactory tubercle
    Ventral pallidum: substantia innominata
    Not part of basal nuclei, but functionally associated
        Substantia nigra
            SUBSTANTIA NIGRA PARS COMPACTA: cell-dense part of substantia nigra. The ones with melanin and dopamine
            SUBSTANTIA NIGRA PARS RETICULATA: part of substantia nigra where cells and white matter mix. Similar cytoarchitecture to globus pallidus medial
        Subthalamic nucleus
    Striatal complex: neostriatum + ventral striatum
    Pallidal complex: globus pallidus + ventral pallidum
Globus pallidus medial and substantia nigra pars reticulata tonically inhibit their targets with GABA
Basic circuit. Explained with movement, but can be applied to other outputs where basal nuclei are involved
    Direct/facilitating circuit: triggers movement
        Thalamus has excitatory connections to motor cortex
        Globus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars reticulata have inhibitory connections to thalamus => Inhibit unwanted movements
        Striatal complex has inhibitory connections to globus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars reticulata, but they don't fire by default
        Before a movement is performed, cerebral cortex activates striatal complex => inhibits globus pallidus and SNPR => activates thalamus => activates motor cortex
    Indirect circuit: suppresses movement
        Subthalamic nucleus has excitatory connections to globus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars reticulata, inactive by default
        Globus pallidus lateral has inhibitory connections to subthalamic nuclei, active by default
        Neostriatum has inhibitory connections to globus pallidus lateral, inactive by default
        Cerebral cortex activates neostriatum => inhibits globus pallidus lateral => desinhibits subthalamic nucleus => activates globus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars reticulata => inhibits thalamus
    Hyperdirect circuit: suppresses movement
        Cerebral cortex directly activates subthalamic nucleus => activates globus pallidus internal => inhibits thalamus
    Dopaminergic modulation
        Substantia nigra pars compacta has connections to neostriatum, using dopamine
        Can be inhibitory or excitatory, depending on the receptor on the target cell (D1: excitatory, D2: inhibitory)
