tensor tympani (trigeminal V), stapedius (facial VII) => muscles that decrease hearing sensitivity
    reflex takes a small time
ampulla: protrusion in the base of the semicircular canals
receptors are in membranous laberynths
vestibular branch of VIII: sub-branches exiting from ampulla, utricle and saccule
modiolus: bone forming the center of the cochlea
helicotrema: connects scala timpani and scala vestibuli, only in the final part of the cochlea
oval window: where stapes hit, connected to scala vestibuli
    waves "enter" through stapes, scala vestibuli, helicotrema, scala timpani
malleus, incus, stapes
cochlear nuclei are in trapezoid body, then decussate, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate, cortex
superior olivary nucleus (pons) => localization of the sound
binaural is bilateral, monaural is contralateral
superior olivary complex: handles binaural info
