Background
    ORBITAL GYRI: medial, below frontal gyri
    FUSIFORM GYRUS: spindle-shaped gyrus, for visual processing
        The more basal of the temporal/parietal gyri
        Anterior, superior to cerebellum, inferior to parahippocampal gyrus
    CINGULATE GYRUS: arc-shaped gyrus above corpus callosum, below the rest of the cortex and white matter
    PARAHIPPOCAMPAL GYRUS: gyrus that continues the cingulate gyrus. Below hippocampus, medial to fusiform gyrus
    ENTORHINAL CORTEX: rostral end of the parahippocampal gyrus. 5 layers
    UNCUS: hook-shaped structure at the rostral end of the parahippocampal gyrus folding medially
    FORNIX: arch-shaped fiber bundle communicating hippocampus and diencephalon/hypothalamus
        Below lateral ventricles
        Frontal medial (hypothalamus), goes more lateral as it goes backwards until reaching above hippocampus
        CRUS OF THE FORNIX: the edges of the fornix reaching the hippocampus
        COMMISSURE OF THE FORNIX: layer of fibers connecting the two crura before they divide => connects the two hippocampi
HIPPOCAMPAL FORMATION: subiculum, hippocampus proper, dentate gyrus
    SUBICULUM: (latin support) below hippocampus proper, above entorhinal cortex. Transition area between 5 and 3 layers
    DENTATE GYRUS: structure at the "end" of the hippocampus proper. 3 layers
    CORNU AMMONIS/HIPPOCAMPUS PROPER: the main body of the hippocampus. 3 layers
    CA1 to CA4: each of the divisions of the hippocampus proper, based on cytoarchitecture
    Cortex is continuous. In coronal section: entorhinal cortex, subiculum, hippocampus proper (CA1 to CA4), dentate gyrus
    Fimbria: fibers leaving hippocampus that form the fornix
